            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AND Friends, although I have ſaid enough, and ſufficient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>viz.</hi> in my two former, to manifeſt and lay open both the Ridiculouſneſs as well as the Weakneſs &amp; Raſhneſs of the Judgment of my Seven unjuſt Jugdes, viz. <hi>James Potter, Oliver Sanſom, William Auſtill, William Cooper, Benjamin Antrobus, John Gidding,</hi> and <hi>Richard Vokins,</hi> junior, as particularly in page 25. to the 32d. of the <hi>Cry, &amp;c.</hi> Yet ſince there is this freſh occaſion given me through their hardineſs, by attempting an Anſwer to it, I think it moſt proper, as needful, to make this ſhort and farther addition to the former, both to continue, as well as to make it yet the more apparently obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to the Eye and view of the Impartial, before I enter upon the direct Anſwer to his and their ſaid Book, for ſhake and remove but their Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> their wicked and unjuſt Judgment, and this, and all the reſt of his and their <hi>Babel</hi>'s building, will ſoon disjoint, ſink down and tumble of it ſelf, and therefore ſhall be ſomewhat the larger on this part here, to the end I may be the briefer on the reſt, tho' I intend not to leave either Stone or Material unturn'd, ſhaken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd or thrown down; and this of their ſaid unjuſt Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief, the principal, or as the Hinge or moving Wheel, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all the reſt or the moſt material of it doth ſtand, hang and depend, and by which all the reſt of their Actions and Works may be the better gueſſed at, and inſpected.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with their Preamble to their ſaid Paper of Judgment, and then place again my further Remarks and Obſervations upon it; the aforeſaid beginning thus, or after this manner, viz. <hi>We whoſe Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, at the requeſt of</hi> Abraham Bonnifield, <hi>and by the conſent of the Quarterly Meeting held at</hi> Redding the 4th. <hi>of the</hi> 3d. <hi>Month,</hi> 1691. <hi>were to hear the Complaints and Grievances of the ſaid</hi> A.

I ſhall firſt begin as with reſpect to their way and manner of hearing them, the which was managed at no other, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor juſter rate then that before I had read much above the half of my Papers that contain'd them, <hi>viz.</hi> my Charges, e'er I was interrupted by <hi>Benjamin Antrobus,</hi> that hot and careleſs Zealot, who I as ſince Broke for I know not how many Thouſand Pounds, that my ſelf

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſeveral Pounds the worſe for him; who ſtanding up, or appearing, ſignified to the Meeting, that it roſe in him, or in his heart, That they or thoſe <hi>my ſaid Papers were but fuel for the fire:</hi> Surely a very unjuſt and no leſs then a Cruel and Barbarous way and method, for either hearing or ending of Difference; but may add, as I ſaid in Page the 30th. of <hi>the Cry, &amp;c.</hi> When hinting at their Injuſtice, what other could I expect from ſuch Burning and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Judges; who doubtleſs, would even every one of them count it hard, raſh and unjuſt if any <hi>Court of Judicature,</hi> throughout the whole Nation, ſhould require their Cauſes, Allegations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Burnt or Deſtroyed before Read or Heard, and much the harder too, if the Judge ſhould pretend a motion from God to do it; but how weak, as well as ridiculous, this unconſcious and conceited Man hath rendred himſelf by thus ruſhing and ſtamping his Idle and Childliſh Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Movings and Motions of God, and no leſs than ſuch, would have believed and received (doubtleſs) then both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick and Divine; notwithſtanding have thus acted below and ſhort of all Rules amongſt Men, both as with reſpect to Law, Morality and Religion, of which I ſhall leave the Impartial to judge. But again obſerve, that it's acknowledged and granted by them, <hi>that there were both Complaints and Aggrievances;</hi> and in the ſecond place, <hi>that they were to both hear and redreſs them;</hi> but yet inſtead of either impartially hearing, or at all, or in the leaſt to endeavour any redreſs, they have multiplyed and made them more, and inſtead of doing me Juſtice and Right, by impartial hearing and ending the Difference, the thing and end for which they were ſo nominated, requeſted by me, and conſented unto by the Meeting, they have both Judged, Sentenc'd and Condemn'd the Complainant, and Aquitted and Excuſed <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> the Accuſed, the Criminals, the Cauſers and Occaſioners of the aforeſaid Complaints, &amp;c. and this is all the Juſtice, Redreſs or Amends that they have made or given me, in ſatisfaction for all the ſo many Wrongs and Injuries that have been done me; and are any ſo ſilly as to think, as ſilly as <hi>O. S.</hi> counts me, as to either deſire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt them, to thus farther wrong and abuſe, evil handle and intreat me, inſtead of doing me Juſtice; or the Meeting to be ſo out, and beſides the matter, as to conſent or appoint them to any ſuch end or work, or to account any at all of ſuch their evil and treacherous Ones, for Apoſtolical or Divine, or other than meer mockery both of God and Man, and tending to no other than the hurt and deceiving of their own and others Souls; for to thus inſinuate and tell, as in Page the 15th. of his <hi>Reviler, &amp;c. viz.</hi> As if the Sence and Judgment that they had received in their waitings in the Light of Chriſt our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172122:2"/>Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he were both the Author and Dictator to ſuch their Treachery and Deceit, who have thus divined a Lye, and then ſpake it as if in the Word and Movings of the Lord: And in the laſt place, as with reſpect to their making of Peace, working Reconciliation, the ending the Difference, the end, (and end only) for which they were ſo nominated, as owned, granted and acknowledg'd by themſelves in their ſaid Paper, and Signed under every one of the fore-mentioned Hands, yet how far they have fallen ſhort of performing their Truſt in the ſaid Matter and Caſe left and committed unto them, any one that is deſirous to ſee, may ſee; and they that deſire to know, cannot but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; for that neither Peace nor Reconciliation is either made or wrought by them, but rather, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 26. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. they have much increas'd the Difference, inſtead of ending of it, and have made it greater, and the Breach far wider than before, and not ſo much as any one of them rightly ended, or ended at all, but inſtead of it, or any thing really in order to it, they have wholly miſtook their Work, miſt the Matter, betrayed their Truſt, and violated all Rules, Ways and Methods practicable, or in order to it; and have cauſe and ground to believe that their wilful Ignorance, mix'd with Malice and Prejudice towards me, for my withſtanding and oppoſing of ſuch their Injuſtice and Treachery, was the cauſe, and wholly and alone the occaſion of it; and therefore their ſaid wicked, evil, and unjuſt Judgment, which they have brought forth and given in againſt me, inſtead of ending the Difference between the aforeſaid and my ſelf, being as the chief, the main, and the principal, the Pillar and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; yea, and Finiſhing or Top-ſtone of this their ſo weak, and ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, feeble and tottering Building, all others being but as Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or Circumſtances depending; I having thus ſhown the weakneſs of, ſhaken and cut down their Props, hewen down their Pillars, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the Stones, and razed the Foundation thereof, without doubt, gainſay or contradiction, down will ſink, and unavoidably will and muſt fall, this their <hi>Babel,</hi> and confuſed Structure and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a broken Wall altogether, and that with both force and weight upon their own Heads.</p>
            <p>And although, as I ſaid in the beginning, I have ſaid enough and ſufficient before; yet, notwithſtanding, for the ſakes of the Poor and Innocent Ones, who have a love in their Hearts to God and his Holy and Bleſſed Truth; I ſay leaſt ſuch, or any of them, ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, catch'd or taken in any of his, or their, cunning and crafty Snares, I thought good to a little further onraval this Man <hi>O.S</hi>'s. own fine ſpun Spiders-Web, as in his Book, <hi>A Reviler, &amp;c.</hi> with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telty and Craft of both the Hands and Heart that wrote it, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172122:3"/>to add to and to make it further appear, to be yet more Notorious and Wicked, and that eſpecially on his part, <hi>viz. O. S.</hi> that pretends to be both the Author and Writer of it, and that in both the Matter, Manner and Circumſtances, I thought good for to give the Reader this farther Account and Relation, and that as it more immediately or particularly relates unto himſelf, and then of the reſt concern'd, as it falls in its order and courſe before me.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as in relation or with reſpect to the ſaid Judgment, that this very Man <hi>O. S.</hi> the Chief or Principal of the ſaid Seven, &amp;c. did himſelf, and of his own accord (ſo far as I know, or ever heard to the contrary) make an offer and propoſe, yea, and that to the very next Quarterly Meeting, held and kept at <hi>Newbery,</hi> it being, (I ſay) the next in Courſe, after that wherein their ſaid Sentence was given forth, for a farther hearing or reference before a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Antient Friends at <hi>London,</hi> ſatisfiedly and equally choſen by us the Parties concerned; and who was alſo ſo particular and diſtinct in it as to nominate two of the very Perſons I might pitch upon or chuſe to make uſe of on my part, if I pleaſed or thought well of them, as ſtated by way of Appeal to <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Antrobus,</hi> in Page the 48th. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> (and which in Page the 45th. of his, <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viler Rebuked,</hi> he confeſſeth as Confuſed and Whimſical) it being thus, or to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> Whither that ſeeing <hi>O. S.</hi> did ſo propoſe for a farther Referrence, and that for this reaſon, that he did not ſee that the ſaid Difference was like to be ended there, <hi>viz.</hi> at the aforeſaid Meeting. Obſerve, (which plainly ſhows and demonſtrates, that it neither had been or was ended before, unleſs they would have two endings) and farther as cited, that he himſelf ſhould be ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of it (Pray obſerve, who but juſt or a little before pretended, and that ſolemnly too; <hi>That what they did therein, was as they received it in their Waitings in the Light of Chriſt their Lord, &amp;c.</hi>) And again, <hi>That it would in his thoughts be beſt ſo to do,</hi> viz. <hi>Refer it.</hi> I do therefore appeal and ſay, Hath he not plainly and evidently ſhown therein, not only his own Inſtability, Confuſion, Whimſicalneſs, as well as Falſehood, Treachery and Inconſiſtency, thereby but Invalidated, as well as Undone, Overthrown and Reverſed that Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judgment of himſelf and the reſt of the Seven; but alſo thereby given teſtimony unto, and approbation of ſomething more Impartial, Equal and Juſt then that of theirs; as likewiſe according to Method and Manner of Law, put a ſtop, or made Replevey to both all, every or any farther Procedure or Proſecution of the matter in any other Meeting or Court, (to ſpeak after the manner of Men) except what is higher, or of more Power and Authority than his or there's; ſo it's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172122:3"/>evident, apparent, and plainly to be ſeen, that as the Wiſe Woman, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, buildeth up her Houſe, ſo <hi>O.S.</hi> like the Fooliſh one, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his down, and that with his own Hands; all which (as ſaid) were enough and ſufficient, one would think, to convince any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious or impartial Reader of both his Falſhood and Treachery, as alſo to ſhew what little Cauſe or Right <hi>O. S.</hi> has, or had, to charge me thus, and ſo often with Confuſion, Whimſicalneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>pag.</hi> 2. of his, <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. as well as in divers other Places that appears thus, and ſo ſhattered, broken and confuſed in himſelf.</p>
            <p>And unto what is here inſerted and alledged, I ſhall yet add and annex as a farther weight of both Shame and Condemnation upon him, and them that imployed him in this Evil and Unchriſtian Work, (by thus adding of Sin unto Sin, inſtead of Condemnation) out of the Book entituled, <hi>Reflections and Maxims,</hi> ſuppoſed to be written by <hi>W. P.</hi> as in pag. 42. and 116. of the aforeſaid, where it is thus written and inſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If thou haſt done an Injury to another, rather own it than defend it; one way thou gaineſt Forgiveneſs, the other thou doubleſt the Wrong and Reckoning.</q> And more to the ſame import in page 43. and 119. <q>We ſhould make more haſte, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> to Right our Neighbour, than we did to Wrong him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And in pag. 120. <q>True Honour will pay trebble Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, rather than juſtifie one Wrong by another.</q> Methods ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wholly and only, and alone approved of and juſtified by the Rules of both Divinity and true Morality; all which ſtill condemns you in this, as well as in all the reſt of your Raſh and Unchriſtian Work.</p>
            <p>But a Word more, as with reſpect to the ſaid Judgment; If you had ſeen or found that you could not, or that you were not likely, or at leaſt at that time, to have made Peace, and ended the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt us, the matter could but have ſtood and remained as it was, (and not have been thus made worſe) but have left and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to another time or further opportunity; and who is it that knows not, (that knows any thing of this nature) that although the thing propoſed hath not at firſt been wrought or obtained, <hi>viz.</hi> The Peace between the Parties differing, yet that through the Prudence, &amp; Patient Forbearance of the Parties choſen or concerned in it, with the uſe of true and Chriſtian means, it hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding been effected and accompliſhed in the end, as many and frequent are the Inſtances that might be cited and alledged in the Caſe.

And farther, as to their falſe and malicious Aſperſion, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, by charging me to act or behave my ſelf like one, or a Man diſtracted; though there was cauſe of temptation enough given me for it by that days work of yours (I mean when you pronounced or gave it) had not the Lord ſtood by me, and been my ſupport and help by that days work; I ſay, as I then told you, and do the ſame again, That it ſhall ſtand and will ſtand in charge and witneſs againſt thee <hi>O. S.</hi> and you all, and that for ever, unleſs you return and repent, for it was a Day and an Hour of the ſtrength and power of Darkneſs; yea, and a work of Cruelty, Force, and of ſore Oppreſſion, as my Soul can ſay of it that bore the burthen and felt the heavy weight of your Mercileſs Hard-heartedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And which in addition to the reſt of your works brought, as may be ſuppoſed, <hi>Thomas Gilping,</hi> a Man of like temper with your ſelves, who neither belong'd to the Meeting, nor yet of the County, neither had any thing to do, or to meddle or make with thoſe Concerns amongſt us, to ſo proudly inſult and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer over me, and as if one appointed as Head and Maſter of the Meeting and Work ye intended that day to be at, <hi>viz.</hi> Judgment, Sentence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who firſt diſcover'd himſelf by Preaching through Mercy, not my Funeral, though my Sentence and Judgment-Sermon, and ſuch a one too, as I think in relation to the nature and ſubject of it, as was never yet preached by any <hi>Quaker</hi> before, which I leave to the juſt Judge of all to reckon with him; for when and where ſuch his Flams and Idle Fables will not ſtand or paſs for Apoſtolick, or Divine Authority, being far ſhort of the Prieſts or Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the like Caſe, for they Preaching before the Judge when ready to aſcend the Bench or Judgment-ſear, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rather excite to Mercy with Juſtice, than Judgment, Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>T. G.</hi> for neither of them, but for you I mean the ſeven to be one, and to ſtand and hold together, and not to be daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to reſolve and fix the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Judgment notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Reader may obſerve was neither of the Meeting nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the ſhame and reproof of his Gray-Hairs be it ſpoken, and ſtand in Record againſt him; and I could ſay more, both with reſpect to this and other matters, particularly relating to himſelf, as he knows I can, and of his ſcornful and inſulting Temper. All which have been obſerved, and he ſpoken to about it, as have been inform'd by Friends of his own County; and farther obſerve, that a Friend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172122:4"/>that was at the aforeſaid Meeting, gave in his Teſtimony againſt their ſuch unjuſt and evil Proceedings, ſaying, That he had been at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meetings in his time, and no doubt but he had, for he was both Antient and a Man of Gray-Hairs, but that he had never ſeen or had been where the like, as with reſpect to Arbitrarineſs, Injuſtice, Force, &amp;c. had been done before; and therefore may be the better excuſed, if like the Prophet, of Old my Face was made as of Braſs, and my Brow as a Flint to withſtand &amp; teſtifie againſt ſuch great and notorious Wickedneſs, ſo publickly done and acted in the Gate, and ſuch groſs Oppreſſion amongſt the Men of Age; and to be plain in it, the very ſtrength of my Loins was as unlooſed, and the ſubſtance of my Life as diſſolv'd within me, and in the cry of my Soul, and the woundings of my Life was it uttered forth unto him, though your Hearts and Ears were hardned and ſhut againſt it; but in fine, as I then told you as before, ſo again, that that Caſe of yours and mine will yet have and come to another hearing, and that before the great Tribunal of the great God and Lord of Heaven and Earth, where my Cauſe ſhall be heard and determined in Juſtice, Righteouſneſs and Truth, for unto him and his Righteous Court of Heaven I both have and do appeal.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> if I had indeed, (tho' falſe, and a Lye) ſeem'd as a Man or one diſtracted, as theſe envious Men have accounted me, for my true and ſincere Love and holy Zeal unto my God, Juſtice and the Truth, yet conſidering that ſuch their Injuſtice and Oppreſſion was none of the leaſt, when only for and on the ground and ſcore of Religion, if as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Oppreſſion maketh a wiſe Man mad;</hi> I ſay the better to be born and allow'd of in me, that he counteth ſuch for a ſilly one; though whether he, or they that thus wronged and abuſed me therein, let others judge, that tho' both ſpoke and acted like a ſober Man and a Chriſtian, as others were Witneſſes alſo as well as they; and it was a hard thing to be thus riſen up againſt (as it were) of all, eſpecially by them that ſhould and ought to have done me Juſtice, and yet for no Mouth or Tongue to move or ſpeak on my behalf, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except the forementioned, that wholly unknown to me, and meerly as accidentally happen'd to be there; Of which and the whole of it, let me add and further ſay:</p>

And further, as <hi>one that broke the Peace of the Church, ſtir'd up Diſcontents, Diviſions, Enmity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a Backſlider, and an Apoſtate from the Way of Truth, and at length into open oppoſition, a yea, that even to both write, print and publiſh Books, ſtuft with Falſhood and Defamation.</hi> And again, (and to the ſame import) <hi>Amongſt the too many that Satan hath beguiled, corrupted and hardned to that degree</hi> (ſaith he) Abraham Bonifield <hi>of</hi> Reading <hi>is one;</hi> But for what cauſe, unleſs ſpeaking the Truth and teſtifying againſt their Hypocriſie and Deceit, is left to the Reader to judge, ſeeing there's nothing but his Say-ſo for it. And to the ſecond part of his and their evil and inconſiderate management of matters, as fore-hinted, as with reſpect to his and their open and publick Teſtimonies, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I pray and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee, O Chriſtian and Impartial Reader, to conſider what treament my ſelf and others have met with all along from them, conſidering our Crime, which was only for being as before of the ſame mind, and for the ſame thing and no other then our aforeſaid Friends were for, and which indeed was the main and principal occaſion of all the future and ſucceeding Differences: And if <hi>O.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alacious Title, and alſo to that part of the firſt and ſecond Page of his before repeated, in all which there's as much and no more of Truth, than of Proof, and that is nothing at all; and what I have written or charg'd upon him, I mean as to the major or principal part of it, he knows to be ſo, and the truth, and neither Revilings nor Scandal, and therefore no occaſion for his Rebuke.</p>
            <p>And then goes on and tells his Reader, that this, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſaid Book, (which may, and ought of right to be counted a peice of Craft or Artifice, then either Religion or Piety) was written by himſelf, but yet ſo covert and clandeſtine, as not to tell him in Truth and Plainneſs, who he or they were that were the Original or Authors of it, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that have ſeen it, are of opinion that its none of his own, nor like his Stile; but however, he is worthy and deſerves to bear both the blame and ſhame of it, ſeeing that he hath ſo far appeared for it, and not to tell of any other Father.</p>
            <p>And further, to his ſo common and frequently charging me, as being a Troubler, one of an unruly Spirit, a breaker of the Churches
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172122:6"/>Peace; it's to be remember'd and obſerved, that the truely Tender and Conſcious were ever ſo accounted of by ſuch as he and they, that were ſo for Rule and Preheminence, I ſay, by ſuch, both in former times and ever ſince, who truly and ſincerely lov'd and fear'd the Lord, and hated and teſtified againſt Falſe-heartedneſs, Oppreſſion and Deceit; and as then, ſo now, neither could nor can by any means be prevail'd upon by any ſuch, their Rules calls them, <hi>Lines of Truth, Balance of the Sanctuary,</hi> or what you will that were not in Truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Truth, and Truth in themſelves; and therefore were ſo uſed then, Perſecuted and abuſed ever ſince, by ſuch that lived and acted in the like evil and envious mind, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fleſh, firſt Birth and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and at which door, the Apoſtacy in Spirit crept in at firſt, and which likewiſe hath proved the Miſery and Calamity of this preſent Age and Day.</p>
            <p>And then goeth on, and tells his Reader, that for the aforeſaid Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of my being a Troubler, of an unquiet Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was reproved and teſtified againſt by the Quarterly Meteing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as its apparent, as in Page the 8th, of the <hi>Cry,</hi> that <hi>W. L. J. B. W. S.</hi> and others, were the cauſe and trouble-makers, through ſuch their inſulting Arrogance and Pride, unleſs ſuch things are good and to be juſtified, and the Detectors of them for reproof, and to be teſtified againſt; and beſides, if true, theſe were not the cauſe but the effects of the aforeſaid Cauſe or Cauſes, and the Meetings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, if it had been true, when groundleſs of as little weight as the reſt; but enough and ſufficient in the foregoing, concerning their teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Sentence, Judgment and the wickedneſs and unjuſtneſs of it. And then goes on and tells him again, of my leaving the Meeting of Friends, to which I uſed before to reſort (obſerve, not belong'd too) and of joyning my ſelf with them that ſome Years ago ſeparated from Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forgetting, elſe not ſo impartial, to inſert, that his Friends (if muſt call them ſo) firſt ſeperted from the others, and kept a ſeparate Meeting ſeveral Years together, at the Widdow <hi>Truſſes</hi> in <hi>London-ſtreet;</hi> and what enconragement to ſo reſort, that permitted them of ſuch bad and ſcandalous Lives, <hi>viz. W. S. E. B.</hi> and <hi>A. M.</hi> as in Page the 9th of the <hi>Cry,</hi> to ſo interrupt, bid me be ſilent, and that it was not my place to ſpeak, that had never by ſuch courſes, or any thing that was indirect forfeited my Chriſtan Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidge amongſt them; Meetings frequently diſturbed and broken up upon me, and in fine threatned with the tying up of my Tongue, at their Monthly Meetings; let their meaning be what it would, tying up of Tongues, whether in a Natural or Spiritual ſence, are both Perſecution and Popiſh; and therefore <hi>O. S.</hi> hath not ſo great cauſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172122:6"/>ſo to make ſuch a buſtle, or to ſeem ſo uneaſie, for my adding to, or mentioning the uſe of the Gagg, ſeeing ſuch evil and unchriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings ſeldom ever center'd or ended in any other, as more at large in Page the 36th of the <hi>Cry, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore what would this Man have or be at, if he knew what himſelf; and if ſuch a Crime with <hi>O. S.</hi> (that Make-bate and Enemy to Peace) and his Companions, for me to meet with the aforeſaid, when have opened the Doors in order as was hoped for Reconciliation, and if ſo, why not as great and notorious a Crime in <hi>George Whitehead, John Kilburn</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Antrobus</hi> that advis'd and excited us to it? and who were alſo both our Preſidents and Example to what we did or acted therein; for if he chargeth me with any other or farther joyning then in order to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, he and they have done me much wrong, and abuſe me in this, as they have done in all the reſt: And what need either he or they to either care or be concerned about me (unleſs to ſwell his Book for a greater gain, or dally with his Reader in it) what became of me, or whether I went any where or no, where if ſuch <hi>a Devil, a Dog, a Woolf, a Swine, &amp;c.</hi> as in Page the 19th and 20th, as forecited, as olſo in the Paper he fixed to my Book of Queries, as in Page the 34th <hi>viz. one of ſuch an unruly Spirit, following the ſteps of</hi> Rogers, <hi>a raging Wave of the Sea, foaming out my own ſhame, a Murderer,</hi> &amp;c. Pray, therefore obſerve how unfit <hi>O. S.</hi> as before, to thus publiſh me for <hi>a Reviler,</hi> and to be rebuked; that have thus exceeded all both Chriſtian and Civil bounds himſelf, as more at large notorious, ſevere and cruel upon the ſame Subject, in the foregoing, in the <hi>Cry, &amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe in the following; and therefore whether (and that as good and ſufficient reaſon for it) that all his caluminating Clamours he creates, and then chargeth upon me and others, ought not of right to be return'd back, and to his own ſhame and reproof affixed and faſtened upon himſelf, and that with double reprehenſion of Blame and Reproof, and as unworthy alſo of further ſpending of Time, Ink and Paper about it, notwithſtanding he makes ſuch a noiſe, and beats both Earth and Air (as I may ſay) as on purpoſe to raiſe a Duſt to blind both the Eyes and Heart of his ignorant Reader. And farther, that although, as I have ſaid, am truly tender of the Truth, and do both love and eſteem the Faithful Followers and Miniſters of Chriſt, yet nevertheleſs cannot be ſo eaſily decoy'd to your end, or charm'd to your intereſt, as to credit or believe that ſuch your fallacious Fictions or lying Vanities are the fruits or proof that makes you appear to be ſuch, as particular with <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> ſo Inſulting and Lording it over me and others, pretending to the ſeeing my inſide, and in fine to the diſcerning of my Heart and inward parts; but more of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172122:7"/>hereafter; nor yet no more of <hi>William Spikeman's</hi> feigned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick ſtrain, to uſe his own Phraſe, in order for Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>viz. to ſtay, and for the continuance of our Meeting in the Court, or before the old Meeting-Houſe Doors, until the Shutters of them did or were minded to open them again.</hi> All which was to have been taken upon truſt, receiv'd and believ'd too for Truth, and Profound and Apoſtolick Doctrine, as well as owned, acknowledged and obeyed for, and as ſuch had not wiſer Heads, and prudenter Tongues and Hands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and corrected the Error, and cleared the Innocency of my ſelf and others from ſuch, his, and their falſe &amp; foul Reflections, ſo often and frequently thrown upon us by them, and by the Author too amongſt the reſt accounted ſo, for <hi>Black or White Devils, ſuch as had denied our Teſtimony, &amp;c.</hi> But what Teſtimony, if continuing longer at the Door were not it? though notwithſtanding altogether falſe; for that we refuſed neither to meet nor to ſit with them there, but not as an Article of our Faith, neither could we be ſo implicit as to let them ſee and act for us, and if by it found denying our Teſtimony in the liberty of the Fleſh and Spirit of the World, for that nothing elſe was our Crime, or laid in charge againſt us; and if ſo, I ſay, and be true as they have ſaid, then pray what were the Antient Friends at the time of the Yearly Meeting guilty of that gave it in our Caſe, and in contradiction to their ſaid Faith or rather Fancy in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? But if any one ſhould object and ſay, <hi>But by what Friends was this matter ſo heard and given in your Caſe againſt them?</hi> To it I do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by ſome of the moſt chief and eminent Friends in the Nation, as in particular <hi>Stephen Criſp, George Whitehead, William Penn, John Oſgood, John Kilburn, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>William Penn</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the aforeſaid, at the ſaid Meeting, for to come down to ſee done, perform and to do it; obſerve, none of all which is either denied by him, taken notice of, neither excuſed or anſwer'd, and yet for him to be ſo treacherous and hardy as to charge me for <hi>a Smiter of my Brethren;</hi> but yet not ſo much as any one particular mentioned or named when, how or wherein; and if my Modeſt and Chriſtian Words were and muſt be ſuch a Smiting, than what can or may be accounted of theirs, but Maiming, Wounding, if not Slaying; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet of <hi>James Lavill's</hi> Prophecy, Actions, Deportment, &amp;c. though ſo Rediculous and Notorious, as in the 6th Page of my <hi>Epiſtle to the Cry,</hi> all which <hi>O. S.</hi> ſlips over, giveth the go-by unto, and paſſeth in ſilence, as elſewhere, and frequent when at a ſtreight, he being, as ſuppoſed, either afraid or aſham'd to meddle with it, as well he may, it being ſo bad manifeſtly contradictory and confuſed; but what that's not allowed and digeſted, if but through pac'd and true
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172122:7"/>to Party and Intreſt, nor no other of any of you the Seven unjuſt Judges, who with the reſt have ſo abetted, ſtood by, and juſtifie notwithſtanding have done and acted ſuch things, but rather as an aggravation upon you to be of ſuch hardineſs of mind, as to pretend as if had receiv'd it from the Lord, as more to the ſame in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; neither is it nor can it be thought I ſhould count otherways of my Antagoniſt <hi>O. S.</hi> in particular, or to be ſo much as thought to be one, <hi>viz.</hi> a Miniſter or Follower of Chriſt, ſeeing as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, and ſhall yet again, that he is ſo far from being a faithful Follower or true Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he is ſcarcely, or not faithful at all, nor yet really true to either God or Man upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſcore or account, nor yet of any or either of the reſt of his party, unleſs that ſuch things as have charged, proved, and in part confeſs'd unto, as in page 26. of the <hi>Cry, &amp;c.</hi> be the tokens, and own'd as the badges of the faithful Followers and Miniſters of Chriſt, and what they be, both my Book of Queries, tituled, <hi>Plain and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Dealing with</hi> W. L. <hi>and</hi> J. B. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>The Cry of the Oppreſſed in Sion,</hi> doth both of them give a full and large Account, <hi>viz.</hi> Arrogance, Pride, Inſulting, guilty of ſpeaking and aſſerting Blaſphemy, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the Attributes only and alone, proper and peculiar to the Omnipotent and All-ſeeing Eye of God, and my Book or Books that contain'd them, are in Verity and Truth, and ſo cloſe, ſo ſimple, and ſo plain upon him, <hi>viz. O. S.</hi> and the reſt, to either receive or bear, ſurely elſe he would never have had the hardineſs to ſo outface his own Conſcience, to ſo aſperſe them, and ſuppoſe that he is not ſo ignorant but to know they are Truth, and neither Lye nor Falſhood in either the whole or any part thereof: And again, let me ſay of that and thoſe innocent Book and Books thou and you ſo mutter and envy againſt, ſpeak evil of, abuſe and vilifie, that it doth ſtand, will ſtand, and alſo in after Ages may ſtand and remain as a witneſs for God, Truth and Righteouſneſs <hi>A. B's</hi> Innocency, and againſt thee, you, and all other your ſuch hidden ſubtil Crafts, Works, and Deeds of Darkneſs, Hypocriſie and Deceit, unleſs you return and repent, and that in Truth and Sincerity: And I know full well what I have done, and whom I have obeyed in the Writing of them, and ſuch Peace, and that Satisfaction in it, that neither thee, you, nor any Man or Mortals are able to remove, bereave me of, or take away from me, <hi>Hallelujah's</hi> and Praiſes be to the Name of the Lord my God, and to the Lamb, who hath been and is my ſupport and ſtrength both in it all, and through it all. And it's to be further noted, that although they have charged the aforeſaid to be ſtuft with Lyes and Falſhood, yet hath not he, they, or any of their Aſſiſtants,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172122:8"/>proved ſo much as one, though thus made a noiſe and an out-cry about it. And again in the ſame page, after his accuſtom'd manner to criminate and abuſe me for a reſtleſs and unruly Spirit, and what for, but barely and alone teſtifying againſt their Injuſtice, Inſulting, Lording, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> crying and calling for Juſtice, as cited all along and throughout the whole, and that to according to the allow'd of and eſtabliſhed good Order own'd and adviſed to be done and practiſed among them, as in page 44. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. and in ſeveral other places. And pray obſerve what a diſturbance it is to <hi>O. S.</hi> and the reſt of them, to either ſeek or endeavour for Juſtice or Relief; and if this be to break the Churches Peace, what Church is it that crying for Juſtice, breaks the Peace of it? ſurely can hardly be thought any other than ſuch a one as <hi>O.

In Anſwer to this part, firſt, that as by the following it's apparent that it was and is a reality, and not a pretence; and that I alſo have ſufficiently proved it ſo, by inſerting the Names of ſome of them, and could have ſaid more, though he thus inſinuates with his own beguiling Crafts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to the other, did think it proper to be brought forth firſt, as being firſt in courſe, and more general; and too for that it had been laid before the Quarterly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other not. Secondly, that of mine being but the private or particular diſſatisfaction of my ſelf, the other as ſaid of divers and ſeveral. And he might have ſpared his Remark and his Thought too, one would think, ſeeing there are caſes and inſtances ſo frequent and often in his, and as frequently hinted in my Anſwer, that are brought forth neither firſt nor laſt, nor indeed at all, though it is to paſs, and you muſt or ought to take it, and that both for Anſwer, yea, and a Rebuke too. And as to his endeavouring thus as before to inſinnate into his Credulous Reader, as if the Friends I hinted, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the ſaid Complaint, were only <hi>R. S.</hi> and my ſelf, I think it both proper and expedient to add to our number one more, and no more now; though I could have further enlarged, but this may be ſufficient at preſent to evidence it for a truth, and that it is nothing but the truth that I have aſſerted or ſaid concerning this matter; and that is <hi>Andrew Hall;</hi> and this alſo further of him, that he was not only one of the Complainants and aggrieved, but alſo he and the Man that drew up the firſt method or draught of it; and therefore <hi>A.

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:172122:16"/>the Impartial to judge of, whether ſo as he hath ſaid, ſeeing I have alledged ſo many as well as material ones beſides it, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9. of my Book of the <hi>Cry,</hi> both in this and of the former Differences.</p>
            <p>And again ſaith he, <hi>I do not remember that it was made appear to us, that the Monthly Meeting did order</hi> W.L. <hi>to Record it.</hi> But <hi>O.S</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is often ſhort, when the matter inconſiſtent with his Ends and Intereſt, elſe he might have recollected what I have inſerted and alledged in my Obſervation on the firſt Head of their wicked and unjuſt Judgment, as likewiſe to be obſerved, not at all denyed by him as in pag. 29. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> it being this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The Subſtance and principal of all the ſaid Charges againſt <hi>W. L.</hi> was not only proved by me before the ſaid Seven, but alſo both confeſſed, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acknowledged unto by <hi>W. L.</hi> which was that he had deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or refuſed to record what was the abſolute and poſitive Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Order of the Monthly Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And I have not forgotten the Apology neither that he made for his excuſes before them, which was that he was loath to trouble the Quarterly Meeting with it; Though ſhould rather have ſaid, to have had his Nakedneſs and Shame for ſuch his Inſolency and Pride laid open before them, and therefore <hi>O. S.</hi> in his ſaying, <hi>That the Subſtance of the Matter was anſwered by</hi> W. L. <hi>in agreeing with the Monthly Meeting to refer it to the Quarterly,</hi> is no more nor other than a meer piece of Craft. For gave them before to underſtand, that it was none of his deſign or intention, whatever his ſeeming agreeing, or the ſubſtance of the matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But pray further obſerve, how that in the very ſame page <hi>O. S.</hi> both owns and confeſſeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Monthly Meeting did refer it to the Quarterly Meeting to end it; and if ſo, if it were not Recorded in the Monthly Book, ought it not to be Recorded there? And in that it was not, where muſt we conclude the Fault but on <hi>W. L.</hi> that had no diſpoſition to that kind of Work. And again, in page. 27. of his citing my Words out of pag. 7. of the <hi>Cry, viz.</hi> That when ſo made and Recorded, that afterwards they deny it to be the act of the Meeting; and in the concluſion of the ſame Paragraph, makes this his Notation upon, <hi>viz. And well they might, for there is no ſuch Record thereof in the Book,</hi> &amp;c. So that if no Record, no truth, though he both confeſſeth and confuteth himſelf into the bargain; but what of that, if his Reader care not, or dare not to be ſo nice Eyed as to ſee it, and if the Recording, more weighty than the Truth, or the buſineſs to be recorded, which way will you ſteer, and whither will you run? And though he flouts me in his <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172122:16"/>with <hi>Billingſgate-Rhetorick,</hi> yet if this be not <hi>Babylon</hi>'s, and that in no ſmall or mean degree, I muſt confeſs I am as ſilly a one as he chargeth me, and underſtand not any thing that relates to either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And then again, in pag. 9. of his <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Its worth the Reader's notice how falſly</hi> (meaning of me) <hi>he dealt with the Monthly Meeting,</hi> &amp;c. But in what, or wherein, he is ſhort and ſparing for want of Reaſon to back his Charge; for after a great Round-about and Ramble, the chief ground alledged by him, was only becauſe that I did not immediately, I mean at the next Quarterly Meeting, bring forth my Charge and Allegations againſt the ſaid <hi>W. L.</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there were neither time nor limitation ſet or given when or where to do it, nor yet either care or notice taken for the ſame to be ſignified to the Quarterly Meeting either by Word or Writing. And how could it be thought that they would credit or take any more notice without it, than when I preſented the Paper of Complaint, containing the Offence and Grievances of divers and ſeveral of us? And therefore 'tis better worth the Reader's noticing, how ſtrange and at what a venture and random-rate he runs, in thus Stigmatizing and Calumniating a Man for Falſhood, that neither broke Promiſe, Engagement, or any Obligation of his own, or any thing ſo much as like it from any other.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame page further undertakes to give an Impartial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the manner of my preſenting of my ſaid Paper of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to the Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Ore</hi> the 15th of 7th Month, 1690. And firſt by telling <hi>That the ſaid Meeting did not think fit for to trouble the whole Quarterly Meeting with our private quarrels, but committed it to eight Friends, which when the Names of them were read unto him, he objected againſt but one of them.</hi> But <hi>O. S.</hi> not ſo ingenuous or plain as to tell and let them know, that I objected againſt, and was diſſatisfy'd with any other hearing, but the knowledge of and the ſenſe and approbation of the whole, and beſides if not the whole, how then the Meeting, as in page 3. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. And how that ſeveral times one after another I told and ſignify'd unto them, That if the ſaid Seven did not end it fairly and impartially, that I was reſolv'd to make my Appeal to the Yearly Meeting; and yet this Man hath the hardineſs to ſay, <hi>and with which A. B. ſeem'd ſatisfy'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,</hi> which never ſeem'd other or further to conſent than as before, and that as only by conſtraint and force, there being no further or other priviledge offer'd or allow'd me but that or none, and if but a meer matter of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termer,</hi> as his own phraſe is, yet ought it then to be open and free, and both the Plaintiff and Defendant with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172122:17"/>like equal priviledge admitted to appear, and be heard Face to Face before the whole: And as to my objecting againſt one of the eight, it was when I ſaw that it muſt and would be ſo, and no other way, and this is true, and he knows it; and yet obſerve, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my objecting againſt the aforeſaid, he was nevertheleſs choſen (though allow'd and approved my exception) and concern'd too, and had a Hand in it, and that from firſt to laſt, though as forehinted, one of another County.</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Of the Seven</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to whom this Service was by the Quarterly Meeting committed I was one, and though</hi> A. B. <hi>is ſo violently ſet, and ſo bitterly againſt me now, I ſuppoſe I ſtood fairer in his Opinion than otherways, having the liberty of Exception allow'd him, and making uſe of it as aforeſaid to exclude one, he might have alſo excepted againſt me.</hi> To the firſt, it was but his Suppoſition, and if it had been as he fondly ſuppoſes, I know not in the leaſt of any juſt Cauſe for it, but was doubtful he was treacherous, as ſince have found to be to true; and if I had objected againſt him, there would have been as much and no more in it than in the other he mentions, and that was nothing at all, for that as before notwithſtanding my Objection and their allowance, he was ſtill kept and continued with the reſt.</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>However,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we undertook this Service I can truly ſay for my ſelf, and believe I may ſafely ſay it for the reſt of my Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, with a conſcious regard to the Honour of God, the Proſperity of Truth, and the Peace of the Church in that place.</hi> To which let me ſay and return, that you are vaſtly and widely out, and beſides the matter in this, and ſuch your Confidence for to either conceive or think that by any ſuch Works of Injuſtice or Evil, any peace or good ſhould come of it, and how other than to conclude it as no leſs than Deceit and Craft, and that in the largeſt and higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to thus tell and talk of the Honour of God, Proſperity of the Truth and Peace of the Church in the doing and practice of thoſe things ſo apparently unjuſt, wicked and manifeſtly contrary unto both God and his Truth, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in which, as apparent you have only ſought and ſerved your ſelves, but have neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him, the Truth, his Name or Honour, let thy and your fluent and laviſh Tongue and Tongues ſay or pretend what you will or can to the contrary; for that tryed you are, ſeen and known by your Fruits, for Words and Pretences will not ſerve, for the Day is broken forth that hath and will yet more and more make manifeſt and diſcover you &amp; your Works and Evil Deeds. And further, <hi>After this manner, and accordingly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>on the</hi> 7th <hi>Month</hi> 1690. <hi>we met at</hi> Reading, <hi>and being gathered together waiting upon the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172122:17"/>deſired</hi> A. B. <hi>who was preſent amongſt us to bring forth what he had to offer to our Conſideration; whereupon he ſtood up, and made a Speech, telling us he was diſſatisfy'd with the proceedings of the Quarterly Meeting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refuſed to let him read his Paper, and inſtead of giving us his Charges againſt</hi> W. L. <hi>and</hi> J. B. <hi>he read to us a Writing containing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he called Reaſons, why he was not ſatisfy'd to bring his Caſe before us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Anſw. And that they were Reaſons, and juſt and weighty ones too, I think that neither he nor any of the reſt can refute, or are ſo hardy as to deny, as in pag. 5. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> too tedious to ſo over and over again, to take up time, and ſwell my Book; and if diſſatisfy'd, why ſo in haſte impatient as not to give me time of further Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing I have told you that I was in truth and reality diſſatisfy'd, and ſo free as to tell and acknowledge before you, that I was ſorry that I had placed ſuch a diſappointment upon you, as alſo that I was willing to pay you for your loſs of Time and Charges; and what could I have ſaid or done more without wrong and abuſe to my ſelf? Which ſhall leave to the Impartial to judge.</p>
            <p>And as to the other part, as in pag. 10. wherein he accuſeth me with reflecting foully upon the Quarterly Meeting, he hath wrong'd and abus'd me therein, for that all that I ſaid or did alledge, was only thus, or to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> Foraſmuch as I conceive that the Meeting was overſway'd by Perſonal Affection in ſome particulars towards the Party complain'd againſt, to act ſo directly contrary to both common Juſtice and Charity, by their refuſing the publick reading or hearing of the Petition, as in pag. 5. of the aforeſaid; and is a conceiving a thing a matter of ſuch crime, or ſo immodeſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or reflecting foully upon the whole, as he has thus inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated? If I had affirmed, or charged it on them all, he might have ſaid ſomething. And again, in the forecited, what is here written relating to the Quarterly Meeting, is not in the leaſt intended by way of reflection upon the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding the great noiſe and clutter that he makes about it to fill the Ears of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der withal. And a word or two more, and that is, Is it likely, do you think, or any in their right ſences, that the Quarterly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did, would, or could refer to them the ſaid Seven they knew not what? though I cannot, and dare not deny but that <hi>O.S.</hi> and others in party might do it, in and with a mental reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Hand, the Head, and the Eyes to the reſt; for that as in pag. 3. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> The Meeting was held and wholly kept in the dark: And as to the other part of his, pag. 11, 12. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he giveth a further relation of my refuſing the committing the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172122:18"/>hearing of the ſaid Difference unto them, the which I have given my Grounds and Reaſons for before, as alſo refer'd the Reader to thoſe pages and places where he may ſee and read them, not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I ſaid, to fill my Book with ſuch over and over, ſhould I every where follow and trace him; and that if they had ſuch power, and ſo large allow'd or given them, as to call and appoint Meetings at their pleaſure, the which I much queſtioned, as well as think that they are not at all able to either demonſtrate or prove, however that they might have had the conduct of more and longer patience and forbearance, if as they pretend were ſo weighty and ſenſible in their Meeting of the fear and preſence of God, as to have waited in the ſenſe thereof for a longer time, than ſo upon the haſt, eſpecially in a caſe where the party was Conſcientiouſly ſcrupulous, than to ſo ſoon after a diſappointment in the Morning, to immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point another to the ſame end and purpoſe in the Afternoon; and as in reſpect to the Conſtitution and Qualification of it, I refer the Reader to pag. 3. as before, as alſo do yet, and ſtill affirm that, as acted by them, they were contrary to all Methods, Orders, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices or Preſidents in the caſe: and as he has not, ſo neither he nor they are able to refute it, or give evidence or proof to the contrary; neither yet had you any ſuch power either given or allow'd you to ſo convene, it being a method ſo manifeſtly contrary to Peace, the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or to ask or demand any ſuch Matter or Queſtion of them: And ſeeing, as you ſay, that their Judgment was that <hi>A. B.</hi> was the occaſion of thoſe Diſturbances and breach of the Peace, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looking ſo high as to the Cauſe, but accounted the Effect for it, or as if you wanted others to give the ſence you pretend to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your Waitings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why were you not, I ſay, as zealouſly circumſpect as to ask of them how and wherein it appear'd I was ſo, I mean as with reſpect to either Words or Actions originally in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but you had gain'd the point, and your end, and that was enough and ſufficient, and then there had been no need to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch a Paper in order to be quiet, that was never yet proved to be either Cauſe or Occaſion of Trouble, unleſs for meeting amongſt you, and uſing my Chriſtian Priviledge. And as to that of Smiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do challenge all and every individual of you, to ſhow and prove where, when, or that ever any Unchriſtian or unſeemly Word or Expreſſion came out of my Mouth, tho' have largely and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſhown, as in pag. 20. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> and elſewhere, ſuch harſh Bitterneſs or Words of Cruelty, as would even aſtoniſh one to hear, as well to the ſhame and defiling the Mouth that ſpoke and uttered them: And yet for all this, they do go on notwithſtanding, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172122:18"/>their feignedneſs after their old manner in their Paper or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent me, as in pag. 13. <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. and dated <hi>Reading</hi> the 24th of the 7th Month, 1690. with their Hands to it, and <hi>Edmund Orpwood</hi>'s to it too, though I have not obſerved it to be any where elſe, and yet <hi>ſtill the Seven,</hi> and <hi>we the Seven,</hi> &amp;c. though ſometimes one Seven, and ſometimes another, and yet this and all the while in their <hi>Waitings upon God,</hi> and <hi>in the Love, and tender Love of God, and its Riſing in their Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. And wherein they do again adviſe me to forbear any more ſmiting of my fellow Servants, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace of the Meeting, that had never broke it, except by the diſcharge of my Conſcience, though <hi>W. L. J. B.</hi> and <hi>W. S.</hi> &amp;c. have often and frequently done it, as in my Charges againſt them, pag. 8. and 9. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. and in divers other places; and yet all this, as they pretend, under the moſt <hi>weighty and ponderous ſence of the Love and Counſel of God and Tendrings,</hi> &amp;c. Yet never did it ſo much as come into their Hearts, nor the leaſt of their Intentions, to either blame or rebuke them for it, the chief and principal Authors and cauſe thereof; and yet in the Concluſion of the aforeſaid to be ſo deceitful and hardy, as to ſo diſſemblingly ſubſcribe, <hi>We are thy Friends, heartily wiſhing thy welfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after this they ſent me another, and ſigned by <hi>W. S.</hi> on the behalf of himſelf and twenty one more, as they ſay; though it's pitty that we may not know them, wherein they charge me afreſh with breaking the Peace of the Meeting, and ſmiting my fellow Servants, but yet alledg'd not ſo much as in one particular caſe, how and wherein (though I have been open and plain in my Charges againſt them, as told them where done, the Day of the Week, the Day of the Month, the date of the Year, with both Circumſtances, Words and Actions, as in pag. 8. and elſewhere of the <hi>Cry</hi>) as if their Words raiſed Matter of Fact, and their only Say-ſo's were proof ſufficient to it. And therefore to the end the Reader may know how little Credit, and leſs Example of the Chriſtian Life the aforeſaid <hi>W. S.</hi> is of at home to his Wife and amongſt his Family, that has thus aſſumed and taken upon him as a Ruler or Governour of the Church, by his thus Signing, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonating the ſigning of Papers, and that not only for himſelf, but for and on the behalf of others, <hi>viz.</hi> one and twenty more of his hid and obſcure Aſſociates, and which, to judge of them by their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, may not reaſonably be thought to be either better or more conſcious than their Fore-man, who with him have all of them charged me with Matter of Fact; but if you will have Proof, and Say-ſo will not do, you wholly marr the matter and miſtake, they're
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:172122:19"/>none of that ſort; and although I was ſo modeſt in my former, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cry,</hi> as only to mention things in generals, yet ſeeing he has made no better uſe of my Civility, ſhall now be more plain and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in them, which as alledged, and in charge againſt him, take as followeth. The firſt by his Daughter, and the other by his Son, as alſo to be obſerved how juſt with the Lord that it ſhould be ſo, that his own Children, the fruit of his Bowels, ſhould be thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to diſcover and bewray his ſo bad and evil Converſation; and if not ſo, or true, why did he not inſtruct and educate them better, before he had took upon him thus to ſway and rule: But to the matter, the Daughter being abroad, or out at Service, and her Maſter and Miſtreſs intending for her diſcharge and turning home, ſhe did thereupon fall a Crying, and made a fearful noiſe and ado, ſaying, <hi>That ſhe would not go home, for if ſhe did, her Father would knock her on the Head, or kill her:</hi> With further adding, <hi>That he had knock'd her down ſtone dead in the place; and that he had been ſo ſevere towards her Mother, that ſhe was about to make away with her ſelf.</hi> The ſecond the Account of his Son, and the which he declared in the preſence and before ſeveral Witneſſes, which was, <hi>That his Father had been ſo cruel and ſevere towards him that he had kick'd him from one ſide of the Wall to the other like a Foot-ball, and thereupon falling into a rage, he curſed both his Father and all the reſt of the</hi> Quakers <hi>in</hi> Reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if as nimble with his Fiſt and Feet as rude and laviſh with his Tongue, there's no doubt at all concerning it, that was ſo bereft of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility, as to call me <hi>Brazen-face, Impudence,</hi> &amp;c. and that in publick too; and did <hi>O. S.</hi> &amp;c. ever hear ſuch <hi>Billingsgate Rhetorick,</hi> to uſe his own phraſe, from <hi>A. B.</hi> by either Word or Writing?</p>
            <p>And then goes on, and in pag. 15. he gives further account, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſecond and further Conſideration, that I did notwithſtanding conſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at a Meeting held at <hi>Reading,</hi> the 4th of the 3d Month 1691. But how far, and to what end did I conſent, but according to what's in their own Paper, <hi>viz. For them to hear, and put an end to the Difference, that being their Buſineſs and Concern, as owned and acknowledged by them, and not for Sentence or Judgment.</hi> And going on, <hi>The which Charges of mine,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being attentively heard, duly weighed, and well conſidered of in the Fear and Counſel of the Lord,</hi> (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſolemn Proteſtations to a Lye) <hi>we gave our Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay again, pray obſerve what a Latitude and Liberty theſe Men can and do take, who dare ſo confidently to tell of their Attentiveneſs, duly hearing, weighing well, conſidering and that in the Fear and Counſel of God: Notwithſtanding one of the ſaid Seven, <hi>viz. Benjamin Antrobus</hi> by Name (as forehinted) did, and that before
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172122:19"/>my ſaid Paper of Charges were much more than about half read, break forth into the following Imprudent Interruption and apparent Diſorder, by inſinnuating as if that it roſe in his Heart, that the ſaid Paper of Complaint or Charges was but as Fewel for the Fire, as in pag. 30. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore what will or can Men think of him, them, or of the Relation they have given, that have thus and ſo plaid the Idle-like, falſe, and treacherous Men, by ſpeaking and making mention of the Name of the Lord, and their duly wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his Fear and Counſel, to give the face of Truth and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to theſe and ſuch things, as if he were ſuch another, or like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves. But remember Men and Mortals, that he is not, nor will not be mocked; but ſuch as you ſow, ſuch moſt aſſuredly muſt you reap, and that although he wait and tarry long, yet that a Reckoning Day will come, and an account to be given both by you, and all of the Deeds done in the Body, whether they good or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be evil, and remember that you have been warn'd.</p>
            <p>The next thing that follows, as in pag. 16. <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. Is the Paper of their wicked and unjuſt Judgment, which hath been ſpoken to ſufficiently before, and the thing he therein recites, is my exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo extreamly againſt it, as in pag. 15, and 16. which I doubt not but the Reader will conclude with me, that if I did, I had cauſe enough given me for it.</p>
            <p>But a Word further, this being, as ſaid, the Hinge or main of your All; therefore again (do not I ſay) ſo miſtake, if ſhould be ſo Charitable, as to count it ſo, for that your Work was neither to determine or give Judgment, or do any thing more further or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways than only and alone as ſigned under your own Hands, the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or putting an end to the Difference; for of this ſide, or ſhort of it, ye did nothing as in the true ſence of doing; for as you know its ſo and true, ſo a Word as common and phraſe frequent amongſt men, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to the like end, when asked by any, What have ye done? Is the matter ended between ſuch and ſuch? Which if not, their anſwer is uſually, <hi>We met ſo and ſo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but could do nothing.</hi> And that what they meant by doing nothing, was becauſe that they did not, or could not end the Difference, make Peace, the alone work or buſineſs they were to do, choſen and appointed for, is clear; for here's no room at all for determining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any thing more or leſs, than only ending the Difference.</p>
            <p>And therefore what further alledg'd, as with reſpect to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or diſſatisfaction of either the one or the other of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Parties concern'd, is fooliſh, frivolous and impertinent to be offer'd or made uſe of in the Caſe, they all and every one of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172122:20"/>them being things and matters only depending, the others being the main, and ſum, and ſubſtance of the whole. But it may be that <hi>O. S.</hi> and his Companions in this Work, were in ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Dream, that they imagin'd themſelves ſo Divinely qualify'd (though thus ſhort of and below the Common Juſtice of Men) and in ſuch a ſtation as ought to be both taken and believed for Apoſtolical, and that whatſoever they do or act as unaccountable, or being queſtioned any further about it, I am afraid, I ſay, that they are for a thorough fixing of what they imagine, and that for no leſs than a divine and irrevocable Church, Cenſure or Decree: And as to the power or diſpoſing Power that reſt's and reſides (as his imports) with Reflection on the Quarterly Meeting in ſuch Matters and Caſes, I matter not how little I know, nor how much I am wanting in my Judgment concerning them, or any at all, if you propoſe or intend not Juſtice, more than Method, Truth than matter of Form, therefore ſhall not trouble my ſelf to diſpute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives or the Power either of the one or of the other, till I find a better management.</p>
            <p>And again, if <hi>O. S.</hi> do account it ſuch a ſtarting aſide, becauſe I at firſt refuſed to refer it to their hearing, yet one would think he might have been more ſparing, ſince as 'tis granted by him, I have ſo ſtrated in again.</p>
            <p>And as to that part quoted by him out of page the 4th of the <hi>Cry,</hi> relating to my refuſing the committing of it to the ſaid Seven, where he alledgeth as if <hi>there were nothing in it of Reaſon, or that looks like Reaſon;</hi> And a little further, <hi>ſo far is he</hi> (ſaith <hi>O. S.) from Offering of Reaſon, that it rather ſhows his reſolute Will than Reaſon.</hi> And further ſaying, <hi>let Him aſſign any Sentence out of it if he can,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore ſhall only Cite what have there alledged and propos'd for ſuch in page the</hi> 5th. <hi>of the Cry,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>As I am herewith</hi> (alluding to the foregoing) <hi>very much diſſatisfy'd, ſo I cannot with a clear Conſcience be free to the bringing in ſuch an evil Preſident for time to come, without Witneſſing againſt it.</hi> The Preſident diſſatisfied with, was a Condeſcention to have the matter thus gone upon or proſecuted, until firſt publickly Read and Communicated to their ſaid Meeting, to whom it was directed and intended, and the Reaſon for it, I being denyed of that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive common Juſtice amongſt Men, leadeth and teacheth to do according to both the Law of Nature, and the Law of God, and which likewiſe common Charity obligeth all ſorts of People of whatever Nation or Profeſſion of Religion, unto which is to give at leaſt the hearing of any ones Petition or Complaint, if they do not care or think fit to take any further notice of it.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:172122:20"/>
            <p>Now if there be nothing of Reaſon in all this, nor that looks like Reaſon, when as in the firſt place I have aſſign'd common Juſtice, in the Second, my diſſatisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Third, my Scruple as with reſpect to Conſcience; in the Fourth, the Law of Nature; in in the Fifth, the Law of God; in the Sixth, the Law of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then indeed I muſt be forc'd to give up the Caſe, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I know not what is Reaſon, neither can I believe that there is ſuch a thing as it in the World.</p>
            <p>And as to the other part of the page, or pages, he is ſo at, in and out, to and fro, ramble and round about, that it's hard for a Man to trace or follow him in ſuch his Crooked and uncertain Paths; and to what he further ſpends time, and waſtes Paper upon, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Reader, that ſometimes I call my Paper of Complaint a <hi>Complaint,</hi> and anon a <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Complaint, &amp;c.</hi> its not worth the further nothing, than only to denote the humility of his and their Supplicant, who in hopes to be prevalent, was willing to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Circumſtance of the meaneſt and loweſt State he could think of or find out. And further to this ſaith he, <hi>He adds a Poſtſcript, as in page the</hi> 6th. <hi>in which he ſays are two weighty Reaſons for a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hearing of the Petition, firſt becauſe the Grievances therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, relate to the Monthly Meeting, ſo not a private nor perſonal Concern, and if this be true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it makes againſt him, for its evident, that the Monthly Meeting did not imploy nor impower him to make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which do return, that both my ſelf and the reſt were free Men, and could do it without either Power or a Licenſe from either <hi>O. S.</hi> or them; and further, that it might relate both to the Monthly and Quarterly too, notwithſtanding not imploy'd either by the one or the other of them, and alſo both can, and ſtill, dare to Exhibit a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint without either the leave or knowledge of any, or either of the aforeſaid, when Managed after this Rate and manner, for that we are Men and not born Slaves, as he and ſome would make us, but perceive he is ſtill upon the miſtake, for I never nor no where have ſaid, that it was the aggrievance or Complaint of the Monthly Meeting, but of Friends belonging unto it; and what if it had come but only from one Man or a ſingle Perſon, muſt it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been denyed to have been heard or Juſtice done him in his Caſe? therefore let me further ſay, as in pag. 13. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. I pray God break the Bands of all ſuch Oppreſſion, and deliver every honeſt Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from having need or coming under their Hands in expectation of either Juſtice or Relief.</p>
            <p>And than again ſaith he, <hi>Its worth the Reader's noting, how falſly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:172122:21"/>he dealt with the Monthly Meeting,</hi> &amp;c. But in what, or wherein, he is ſhort and ſparing for want of Ground for his Charge, and which after a great round about, the chief Ground of the accuſation from no other Cauſe, but only becauſe that I did not immediately or at the next Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Ore,</hi> bring forth my Charges againſt <hi>W. L. J. B.</hi> yet did the Paper of Complaint containing the grievances of ſeveral others beſide myſelf, as moſt proper to be firſt, though no Limitation given or time ſet me by them, nor either ſet or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by my ſelf, therefore better worth the Reader's noting, how ſtrange and at what a venture rate this Man acts, and runs in his Stigmatizing and Calumniating; for how could I deal falſly by them, or any when under neither Promiſe or Obligation, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted.</p>
            <p>And then goeth on, and makes as if that the only alone Cauſe and Reaſon of Friends refuſing to record their ſaid Paper, of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unjuſt Judgment, at the enſuing Quarterly Meeting held at <hi>Newbery,</hi> was partly or only becauſe of my troubleſome Behaviour there, and partly becauſe ſome Friends were willing to try what might be done, as with reſpect to my Repentance and Recovery. As to the firſt, I was it may be a trouble and a troubler unto him, for ſo aſſerting and undauntedly conſtant to the Truth and my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and could not by any means be prevail'd upon to ſubmit or truckle under his and other the Seven, ſuch wicked and corrupt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and crying againſt their Oppreſſion, and telling of my appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Yearly Meeting, in caſe I could not have Juſtice there, which its moſt probable did ſo ſtartle and awaken him, that he, even he himſelf, did then and there, and at that very time, offer for another Meeting, and propoſed both the Method and Manner of it, and mention'd the Names of ſome of them he thought moſt fitting and capable to be aſſiſtant in it, as occaſionally, is elſewhere hinted, though left wholly out in his Narrative, and which makes good and fixeth the Truth of my Title upon him, <hi>The Treacherous taken in his Treachery,</hi> &amp;c. And as to the other part, of ſome being diſatisfy'd with the Reading of the aforeſaid and the whole againſt the Recording of it, is nothing but the Truth, and truely and really ſo; and if not, ſeeing he is ſuch an Artiſt at it, why did he not procure a Certificate from the Friends of the ſaid Meeting to teſtifie to the contrary, as was procured by him from them of <hi>Charlow,</hi> of which you may hear more hereafter; and yet for all this, he goes on and tells the Reader, That <hi>he had given a plain and true Account,</hi> &amp;c. So hardy and void of Shame is he, that although he pretends to tell of <hi>A. B</hi>'s. ſhifting Tricks, yet in the mean thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172122:21"/>laying open and diſcovering his own. And yet after all this, to ſo confidently outface and deny it, <hi>viz.</hi> As being the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the ſaid Appeal; and what value hath ſuch a one of his Credit, that's ſo void of Truth with his Tongue? And this further, what if through his ſubtilty and craft, the Writer to the Meeting was ſo prevailed upon, as not to Record it, he being one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alſo, which whether, as he hath ſaid, remains ſtill as a Queſtion, ſeeing he can ſo ſay, and unſay to ſerve himſelf and ends, and the which he uſeth as a trick to invalid the force and truth of my Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; yet if not Recorded, and ſhould grant it ſo, there's a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Truth and Verity of it in his own Heart and Conſcience that will not be blotted, nor never can be razed out neither in Time nor Eternity, except he be humbled and repent, how ſhort ſoever he doth or may pretend as with reſpect to his Memory; but treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and falſe as in one, ſo in all; for neither was <hi>Stephen Criſp</hi> or <hi>George Whitehead</hi> either mentioned or propoſed by me, or any one elſe, but wholly and alone by himſelf, as can and do appeal to the Friends that were there for my Witneſs.</p>
            <p>And what if by my Letter afterward, I mention'd a neceſſity to appeal, doth it at all invalid the Truth of what I have aſſerted, as with reſpect to the propoſing of it at the Quarterly Meeting at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry?</hi> ſurely no, and but an Inſinuation and Impoſing upon his Reader; and whether, as my words were, if he had honeſtly cited them, <hi>viz.</hi> neceſſitated as it were to appeal from time to time, both plain and apparent that the Appeal was not new, but old and depending.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>He hath,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>repreſented things in his Book for otherways than in truth they were, but he is hobled in the doing it, that from his own Book, his falſhood appears,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But ſhows not either how or wherein, and further makes the ground of my refuſing to ſtand Tryal before the ſaid Seven, whom the Quarterly Meeting upon my Complaint had refer'd it to, becauſe my Complaint was not openly read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To the firſt part <hi>O S.</hi> is ſtill, as always beſides the matter, to ſo tell &amp; talk of Tryal, Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for I was no Criminal, then no need of tryal, but the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff or Accuſer, nor a Priſoner for Sentence, Judgment; but the matter as rightly ſtated, is truly and only thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Two or three Friends are at a difference, and they chuſe Arbitrators of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make up the Breach, and ſet them at Friendſhip again; in the which caſe, as thus truly ſtated, there's no need of either Judge, or Judges, Jury, or Tryal, but Wiſdom and Honeſty in the Perſons ſo choſen for to both do and anſwer the end of their Choice, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:172122:22"/>to ſet the Offended at one again; which had the ſame been found, and that in the leaſt degree in you the ſaid Seven, the matter had been, no doubt, made up, and the Difference between us ended long ago; but <hi>O. S.</hi> and the reſt are ſo much for <hi>Oyer,</hi> in their own Caſe, and more for <hi>Terminer</hi> in anothers, that they have miſt the Point and loſt the Caſe again: And as to the other <hi>[a word more]</hi> you being only ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> Arbitrators or Peace-makers, why may not a Perſon ſo concern'd, eſpecially when can give a good and ſufficient Reaſon for it, as in pag. 45. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> and part of which is alſo cited by him, viz. <hi>If diſſatisfaction with the firſt Choice, the ſaid Seven be permitted the priviledge of a Second before a great number:</hi> And is it not common and frequent among Men both to allow and do it? and yet what a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal would <hi>O. S.</hi> make me to be, for but deſiring or requeſting the ſame. And why was not the Complaint read in the ſaid Meeting? And ought it not of right to have been read there, and in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and hearing of them to whom directed and intended? And are they not ſet up and held to that end and purpoſe? But <hi>O. S.</hi> you may ſee is for no ſuch juſt and impartial Methods, whereby each, all, and every Member may be made partakers of the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and priviledge: And again do ſay, that the Quarterly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not appoint them a Work that they neither knew nor underſtood themſelves, as more at large in pag. 3. of the <hi>Cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what Juſtice do you think in Reaſon may be expected from <hi>O. S.</hi> and ſuch as he, in caſe it ſhould be granted as the Meeting's Act, that ſo accounteth of an Appeal, and that in a Religious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious concern, and that to the moſt Antient and Reputable of the Society?</p>
            <p>And further, out of pag. 6. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> viz. That I did not refer the matter to the ſaid Seven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without a Conditional Reſerve: Which is true, and I own it ſo, but yet but the ſame, and no other reſerve than what I had told and ſignified unto Friends at the ſaid Meeting, both over and over again; and therefore if a Reſerve, not a private or ſecret one, but ſuch as was not only ſincere, but honeſt and reaſonable too; if it be either Honeſty or Sincerity for a Man to look for and expect Juſtice and Impartiallity from you in his caſe, eſpecially when he made Requeſt for Juſtice againſt Offenders; and therefore how ſo prone to Contention and Quarrelling in it, he idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charges me with for telling the Meeting, and continuing in the ſame mind, that if not ended fairly and impartially, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make my Appeal. And what Sincerity can Men reaſonably think is in the Minds and Breaſts of ſuch as would put a limit, and lay a Bar to hinder an Appeal for Juſtice, which is permitted by the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:172122:22"/>Laws; and the priviledge of every <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, and allowed of in all the Courts of Judicature in <hi>England,</hi> and by thoſe agreed on good Orders too; acknowledged and allowed of by themſelves: And when I, as before ſignified my ſaid Intention of Appeal, did not <hi>John May,</hi> one of the ſaid Meeting, both ſecond and allow it, by ſaying at the ſame time and Meeting, <hi>viz.</hi> or that I might bring it back to them again; therefore it's to be thought that <hi>O. S.</hi> wanted Matter to help make his Book bulky, elſe would never have been thus found, as the Proverb is, <hi>Building Caſtles in the Air;</hi> And had I not good cauſe given to ſuſpect their Sincerity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seven, who have ſince proved themſelves ſo Treacherous.</p>
            <p>And again, ſo fraudulent and falacious is he in his ſtill continuing, doting and dreaming about the Authority of their Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judgment, as in p. 20. to uſe his own Phraſe, <hi>That he runs himſelf a Ground moſt ſhamefully, by not making any manner of diſtinction between Doing and Acting a thing with Judgment,</hi> that is, diſcretion, and paſſing, pronouncing, or giving of a Judgment, Sentence; I think that ſober People ſhould be very cautious of being over credulous to the Words of any that dare uſe ſuch Sopheſtry and Craft, leſt they hazard put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of their own Eyes, and then made to grind at their Mill; and then ſcoffingly draws the like crafty Concluſion from it, <hi>viz. That it is a ſign he is a Man of ſmall Judgment himſelf, and if have a mind to have Buſineſs done without Judgment, they may ſend for him, &amp;c.</hi> To the latter part, <hi>And if any of Treachery and Craft, I know not the Man under the like Circumſtances that can exceed him at that work.</hi> And again in the ſame page, <hi>To what purpoſe do Perſons hear Differences, but to end them?</hi> I ſay ſo too, and the only Point in Differance betwixt us, for had thou <hi>O. S.</hi> and the reſt of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions done that, you had done all the whole, and the Controverſie had ſoon been ended, but you did not Rightly hear as fore-hinted, nor at all or in the leaſt end it, and therefore with a twofold wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you are found Guilty, and Condemned by your ſelves, even out of your own Mouthes.</p>
            <p>And then further, tells his Reader, that <hi>A. B. hath another exception againſt them, meaning of the Seaven, and is angry that we gave any Judgment at all, alledging that we were not appointed for Judges, but Reconcilers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And, if he were angry, ſhall appeal to the Reader, if not cauſe for it, ſeeing what he alledges, is both true, owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, confeſt, yea, and ſigned to by themſelves, as in pag. 15. of his <hi>Reviler;</hi> and therefore as in his to me, whether <hi>O. S.</hi> doth not ſhew his own Folly (it being as cited, ſo granted) as both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the latter doth his falſeneſs. But enough of this, it being
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:172122:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>as I may ſay in a manner the ſubject of the whole, and every part of this his Work, <hi>viz. The Treacherous taken in his Treachery,</hi> And therefore may I not further add, and that juſtly too, and return upon him and all the reſt in his to me, <hi>viz.</hi> What a Contrivance hath he and they made through ſuch there Partiality by reſpect to Perſons more then either Juſtice or Truth, to both continue and perpetuate Diſcord and Strife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that as confeſt, as before hinted, were choſen to make Peace, and put an end to the difference, as alſo to be obſerved, there's as little occaſion, except to ſwell his Book, for his ſo telling of flying off, or one on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, by one or the other of the party concern'd, ſeeing the thing as propoſed, and the matter aſſigned was never done, nor never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in a true and Chriſtian method in order thereunto. But to <hi>O. S.</hi> one thing more, for it's pity but he ſhould have his due, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſo much deſerves it, and that is in ſuch his Falſeneſs and Treachery, in his quoting or citing out of mine, which at preſent take only theſe two following Inſtances, the firſt of them out of pag. 6. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> and inſerted in pag. 5. of his <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. where he thus words it, <hi>viz. That it ſeems that the difference was but flenderly grounded</hi> (alluding to my charge againſt <hi>W. L.) if it wanted to be made out by Remarks made upon his Perſon and Qualification.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, as forehinted, my words were theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Remarks made upon both his Charges, Perſon and Qualification; where it's to be noted, that the principal and moſt material Branch, or part, is wholly left out and omitted by him; as the like in what he has cited out of pag. 13. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> where he words thus, <hi>viz. A Meeting intended for Judgment and Sentence,</hi> &amp;c. (though I queſtion not that he and the reſt of them intended o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> denied it for any other, as their Actions make appear, whatever they have ſaid or ſigned) whereas my words were theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Meeting not intended for Judgment, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but hearing and ending the Difference. And again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he tells me, as with diſdain, in pag. 4. of his <hi>A Reviler, Of the prophane Hands that mine</hi> (meaning my Books) <hi>may happen to come into, ſhall therefore diſcover to the Reader the Qualification of one, what if I ſhould ſaid, an Author of his, but am ſure can prove an Informer, who upon occaſion happening to be ſpeaking of our honoured and eſteemed Friend</hi> George Fox <hi>the Elder ſaid thus, or to this effect of him,</hi> viz. <hi>Either that he was a Rogue, or a very Rogue, or that he believed him to be ſo.</hi> But a Word more, which is enough, and do think more than enough to this matter I have been ſo often, and large upon, as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>O. S.</hi> comparing of himſelf and the reſt to a Judge in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> is alſo as wholly wrong, and a falſe and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172122:23"/>Treacherous compariſon, and they widely out and beſides the matter, as often hinted and alledged, for that you were not for, or to be as Judge or Judges at all, but Reconcilers; and one would think that there were no need for to tell you ſo often what your ſelves have told others, and have ſigned and given forth to, and that in Print under your Hands, as in pag. 15. of the <hi>Reviler, &amp;c.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was your Commiſſion, if I may call it ſo for Oyer and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner, <hi>viz.</hi> to hear and determine, but to hear the Grieviances, and to put an end to Differences; And therefore, rather to be ſaid for <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Salvo,</hi> to hear and unite, or <hi>Oyer Salvo expiato,</hi> to Hear, Unite, Satisfie, Pacifie and Appeaſe: but inſtead of making uſe of <hi>Salvo,</hi> applying a Plaiſter, or at all for healing, you have made ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Inciſions in the Wound, that have laid open to the very Bone-like unskilful Empericks, then good Phyſitians to diſect, cut off, and deſtroy the Life, then indeavouring to either Salve or ſave it, and yet how often &amp; frequent is <hi>O. S.</hi> ſtill and all along even throughout his whole <hi>book,</hi> a harping upon this String, though it giveth ſuch a falſe and uncertain Sound. But yet nevertheleſs and for all this, let me ſay the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, notwithſtanding the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Foundation of Mens Building are thus ſhaken, do totter, reel and and are ready to fall. But if any ſhould ask and ſay, What then doeſt thou count as the Foundation of God, that is ſtable and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. To which do anſwer, Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Juſtice, and that through all Generations, and the which theſe Men having ſo knowingly ommitted and thus ſwarves from, have thereby plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves as into a Labyrinth of Confuſion and Darkneſs, I mean as in reſpect to the Caſe and Matter depending betwixt us. And yet for all this, in pag. 20. of his, <hi>A Reviler,</hi> he is ſo void of Reaſon, raſh and deſperate, that he affirmeth, that it is a folly next to Madneſs to ſay as I did, that they, viz. <hi>The ſeven were to hear and end all Differences</hi> but not for Judges, or to give Judgment, on which ſhall leave the Reader to make his own Obſervation, when he takes a view of their own Paper, in ſo many words, that ſaith To hear and end the Difference, was the end for which they were appointed, as in pag. 15. of the forecited, as alſo in the <hi>Cry:</hi> and ſurely no rational Man that ſhall read this, but muſt conclude of him, that if not Mad, yet little leſs then diſcompos'd.</p>
            <p>And then proceeds further, as in pag. 12. of his <hi>Reviler,</hi> with which indeavours to inſinuate into his credulous Reader, as if I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed him at pleaſure, becauſe I affirmed his propoſing the Appeal and the Originally, and Author thereof, which I account no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, if he does, becauſe its ſo and the truth; and he knows it too,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:172122:24"/>as well as I, what e'er may pretend, as with reſpect to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if his Heart were honeſt, and his mind ſincere? But of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and more as it falls in courſe.</p>
            <p>And further, citing what I charged upon him in pag. 42. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> which was, as with reſpect to his amazement and ſeeming great Surprize, endeavouring for flight and obſcurity, when I met and ſpoke with him at <hi>Grace-church-ſtreet Meeting.</hi> Anſwer to the which he doth but as beg the Queſtion, as with reſpect to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or not knowing that he had done any thing for which he need hide himſelf from me, and further with this Addition to it, viz. <hi>that he did not know before that I counted my Self ſuch a terrible Body, that the ſight of me ſhould affrighten him.</hi> To which do return, and if not afraid <hi>O. S.</hi> why in ſuch haſt for to get a way to hide? as in pag. 42 for I had neither Whip nor Rod in my Hand, nor ſo much as Thought in the leaſt of any outward Puniſhment on thy Body; but as the good man ſaith, ſo its found and made good in thy Caſe <hi>viz. That the wicek flyeth when none purſueth,</hi> &amp;c. ſave the inviſible Hand from which neither thee nor any can hide, which is more terrible and affrighting to the Wicked then a thouſand Witneſſes of Men; and it was that without doubt, and not me, that made thee ſo afraid, and to ſeek for a place to hide.</p>
            <p>And as to his charging me with, <hi>In and Out, Staggering and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy,</hi> I think no one under his Circumſtances has leſs cauſe to Charge another with, the thing he is ſo Guilty of himſelf, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Propoſing for a Reference before Antient Friends, as before, and yet his afterwards declining and denying it both, as well as in his offering me ample and free Forgiveneſs that he counted ſuch a Criminal, as in a Letter ſent me from <hi>Abington,</hi> dated the 6th of the 12th Month, in 1695. Yea, and that three or four Years after their ſaid Judgment they placed ſuch a Weight upon, and annexed the Divine ſence and Counſel of God to it with ſuch Confidence, for ſo much as offering or attempting the Reading of a Paper in the Monthly and Quarterly Meeting, after it was given forth againſt me as in pag. 22. of his <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. And pag. 23. as one of as little Conſcience, for my more then ordinary Condeſcention in the Offering of forgiveneſs to thoſe that had in no ſmall degree offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, yea, and that after my ſaid Book the <hi>Cry,</hi> was both Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and good part of them Publiſhed and given forth; his words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, viz. <hi>I deſire and intreat thee to call in thy Books again, and it ſhall be Excepted, be Satisfaction, and ſo Let the Controverſie be ended.</hi> Therefore with what Conſcience or Face, I ſay, can this Man thus charge and calumniate others, with of in and out, Staggering,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172122:24"/>and Reflection on the account of Conſcience too, that is ſo in and out, ſtaggering; yea, and reeling too, and not only go Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with himſelf, but with the Truth, good Conſcience and ſound Reaſon: And as for my offering ſuch a free and Voluntary Forgiveneſs to them, as in pag. 18 of the <hi>Cry</hi> and p. 22 of his <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viler;</hi> if their were nothing elſe to be ſaid for it, yet the Prudence of them they have ſeemed to have their works in ſuch eſteem, might be Satisfaction, who that after they had Lanched ſo far as to account ſome no leſs then <hi>Devils</hi> in fleſh, yet have in proceſs of time and on further conſideration, moved and endeavoured for a free and Voluntary paſſing by. But enough of this, ſeeing I have to do with ſuch as are accounted Chriſtians; and what if after this, they ſlighting and refuſing my True and Chriſtian offer, and begin to examine and Catechize me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when I came to paſs by and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, if Conſcious of it then; for as there is no room, ſo as little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I mean without a change to either tender or offer it any farther; And therefore if Rightly conſidered, whether it ſtood me not upon to ſecure my Conſcience, by continuing my Teſtimony; for who is he or the Man that would not keep a reſerve in reſpect to the ſafety of a good Conſcience, I think none that ever knew the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of one, and their Teſtimony continued, if they had any to bear, and rather the more in this caſe, ſeeing that <hi>W. L.</hi> did not only continue, but renew and make addition to his Pride, the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my bearing it againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how can the Effects ceaſe, until the Cauſe be removed, notwithſtanding I endeavour Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet again after the Meeting at <hi>London</hi> had prevailed upon me to ſign their ſaid Paper in order to it, and yet, and ſtill refuſed by them; and it may be alſo further obſerved the ſmall eſteem that <hi>O. S.</hi> hath to either Conſcience or Teſtimony, that makes ſuch a remark to both, upon my reſerve to keep and preſerve them; but I bleſs God that my <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not placed upon the reward of Man or from Man, nor my Teſtimony to get me intereſt amongſt them, and it were well if <hi>O.S.</hi> could ſay ſo too, if in truth; but his Actions ſhews to the contrary, to all that have not their Conſciences in theſe as large as his own, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his pretended concern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to thus ſtand by and abet ſuch things that are both a ſhame to Men and Chriſtians, as firſt by his propoſing for an Appeal, and afterwards denying it, by his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me Peace, Forgiveneſs freely; yea, I ſay, and to ſo deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to it too, as before, after that my Book was publiſhed, and a great part of them diſpers'd abroad, who but a little before they accounted me as little other than a Reprobate. Oh the depth of Darkneſs, deep Hypocriſie and Deceit: But more of this hereafter, and yet
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:172122:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>for all this, to tell another of <hi>Babylon, In and Out, Confuſed, Shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to return to make good my ſecond and freſh Charge againſt <hi>W. L.</hi> as with reſpect both for continuing and renewing his Pride, doaffirm and alledge by, and in his ſo aſſuming ſuch an abſolute prerogative, and paſſing ſuch an imperious and controuling Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and Repremand upon the Action and doing of the aforeſaid Antient Friends at their ſaid Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and who were the moſt of them accounted as the Principal Friends in the Nation, <hi>G. W. A. R.</hi> and <hi>J. S. viz.</hi> with divers and ſeveral others, and that by and in his ſaying, <hi>That what they had done at the aforeſaid, relating to this matter, ſignified nothing.</hi> But this not ſo ſtrange neither, when we conſider his frequent Practices in theſe and the like Caſe, as particularly, in refuſing to be aſſiſtant to Friends, in the indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the getting open of the Old Meeting houſe Doors, as he ſtood a Truſtee on this behalf, but on the contrary, ſtirring up and raiſing of Scruples and Diſſatisfactions in the minds of others, in order to their Diſcouragment, notwithſtanding that the Friends for the County had written and adviſed for it; yea, and further expreſſed themſelves after this manner, <hi>viz. And we do not ſee how</hi> W. L. <hi>can be clear without uſing his utmoſt indeavours to give Friends relief in that caſe:</hi> as more at large in pag. 6. of my Book intituled, <hi>Hidden things revealed,</hi> &amp;c. And at another time, when the aforeſaid Friends had upon occaſion adviſed us here, as with reſpect to choice of Burgeſſes to ſet in Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> that we would endeavour and take care to Chuſe or Vote for ſuch as might be hoped to be fit Perſons for that Service, do good in their place. But <hi>W. L.</hi> inſtead of promoting of it, as deſired, did wholly and with all his Intereſt and Power, oppoſe and withſtand it all, which if <hi>O. Sampſon</hi> accounteth of it but as ſmall, as with reſpect to me, yet in reſpect to the aforeſaid, and more to Truth, he might have counted them, one would think as <hi>A. B.</hi> has done, <hi>viz.</hi> not as ſuch ſmall, but rather great and Capital ones, and ſuch as moſt plain and apparently manifeſt his ſelf-will and conceitedneſs, as well as his Emperiouſneſs and Pride, and the which three laſt Inſtances to any impartial Reader, were enough, one would think, without any thing further (though there may be ſo many more) to both prove and affix upon him, the Subſtance of all, or the whole matter in Charge and alledged by me, as with reſpect to his Arrogance and Pride, and what I ſuggeſted, as with reſpect to the loſs of my Papers at <hi>London,</hi> it is true, and as I have ſaid; and as to the other part of the ſame Paragraph, there was no Reaſon at all,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:172122:25"/>or in the leaſt as before, but that the Friends at the Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> ſhould and ought by the Rules of Equity and Reaſon, as I conceive, to have found themſelves concerned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and much more to have brought <hi>W. L. J. B.</hi> &amp;c. the Offenders to a Senſe and acknowledgment of their Unchriſtian carriage and deportment; yea, and to have repented of it too. As for <hi>A. B.</hi> to ſign the Paper in Compliance to their adviſes and deſires, though I dare not ſay, neither would give way ſo much as to think, but that the aforeſaid intended and deſigned well in what they did; and as in order to the effecting and promoting of Love and Peace amongſt us; but yet on the other Hand, as hinted, cannot but muſt needs (likewiſe) conclude that their was a ſhortneſs ſomewhere (and to provable to be on <hi>O. S.</hi> and their part) in that their was no farther care taken (or at leaſt that ever I could find) in the ordering and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging part, for the true and hearty going on and through it, in its due Method and Order, and according to the way of Truth and thoſe good Rules, both owned, acknowledged to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of amongſt us, yea, and that a double Reaſon for it, (<hi>viz.</hi> ſo to think) for that I had yeilded and condeſcended ſo far, and ſo largely on my part; but neither did my Signing the ſaid Paper at all, or in the leaſt beſpeak the aforeſaid to be Innocents; for if Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, their was neither Ground-room for, cauſe or occaſion, to either deſire or advice, to paſs by or forgive, if they had but ſo much as imagined or thought that their was no offence committed, and therefore the more apparent that <hi>O. S.</hi> (as his Phraſe is) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus into a Rage himſelf, to ſee that neither Policy, Subtilty nor Craft, could abate my true and ſincere Zeal, nor weaken the Stroak of due Judgment and Reproof that is, I ſay, come upon, and that hath thus Surrounded him, and that on all and every Hand for his thus temporizing and playing the Hypocrite. And as to what I have ſaid in reſpect to <hi>G. W.</hi> if I have miſſed the Truth in it, ſo much as in one Jot or Tittle, I ſhould be ſorry for it, (but if not, have no cauſe to Repent, though as a <hi>Nathan</hi> to a <hi>David</hi>) the ſaid Paper of his, being as followeth <hi>viz. Having heard ſome of</hi> A. B's. <hi>Complaints,</hi> &amp;c. Then it ſeems there were ſome, and ſeeing but ſome of them heard it, naturally imports that there were remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for all this, without any further Hearing or Notice taken, whether thoſe heard or thoſe unheard, were true or no, <hi>A. B.</hi> in the firſt place is to be adviſed, as in pag. 23 of the <hi>Cry,</hi> to behave himſelf Peaceably, and as a Man of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Note, Though the aggrieved and complianant, and that againſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:172122:26"/>others for their Unpeaceableneſs and Incivility to, as well as Uncharitableneſs, and that in Deportment, Words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in Meetings for Worſhip and others, as at large in pag. 3.4, 5, 6. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> where its plainly made appear that they and they only were the Cauſe, the Ground, and Occaſion of the ſaid Difference.</p>
            <p>But again, <hi>And as he approves himſelf a Man of Peace, to own him and record him as ſuch.</hi> Which to me is in a degree an apparent, aſſent to and an approbation of their ſo Wicked and Unjuſtdoings, in caſting out or Excommunicating me, and upon as unfair and unreaſonable Terms, as rightly conſidered, to receive and to take me in again, and which would be and prove no other at all then to give my Heart, my Conſcience, and my Teſtimony to the lye, that the Lord has raiſed up, and concerned to ſtand and to bear againſt ſuch groſs Impiety and Wickedneſs; neither was it accounted Unchriſtian, or want of Chriſtian Charity in the Antients in the beginning of the Reformation, nor in times paſt among our ſelves, to Teſtifie and Witneſs againſt the Pride and Lording of the Prelates (and this we know, whoever ſhut their Eyes) and will not ſee that it is not Profeſſion altereth Quality, nor Name; the Nature of things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding <hi>Stephen Cripes</hi> was quite of another mind and Apprehenſion, concerning me and them, who only adviſed me <hi>to Patience in the exerciſe and management of it towards them, and then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Thou wilt come to Reign over them</hi> viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the aforeſaid; and then Seconded it, <hi>Iſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain thou wilt come to Reign over them;</hi> who had both the ſight of my Paper and the hearing of my Complaints, as well as <hi>G. W.</hi> And my ſaid Paper, as hinted, was in the Cuſtody of the aforeſaid when he Dyed, and through which means the perfecteſt Copy came again to be loſt. And as to what I further ſaid, as with reſpect to the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Judgment, I do ſtill ſtand by and affirm with this Proviſo, <hi>viz.</hi> when appointed and intended for Judges or Judgment, that then it ought and of right it ſhould be fixed upon the Head of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, though as it is moſt evident and apparent, the aforego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have Wittingly and Wilfully ſpared the Tranſgreſſors, and affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it on the Head of the Innocent. And as to what he hath fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurmiſed at the latter end of pag. 24. of his, <hi>viz.</hi> As if my affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Judgment in my own caſe, were not upon what was wrong, but upon what I called wrong. To which do return, <hi>viz.</hi> That if what I have alledged and proved, as well as charged be not wrong, then may the truly impartial conclude with my Self, that their is nothing that is true or right in the whole World, but Pride,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:172122:26"/>Inſulting, Over-ruling, Lording over others; yea, and even Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy it ſelf, are not at all as in the leaſt Vicious or Vices, but the choiſeſt and higheſt degree of Vertue &amp; Perfections; neither is or has it been my drift or end in the leaſt, as inſinuated by him, to make my ſelf Judge in this or any other Caſe of Difference, but to evidence and prove what I have, or do alledge both from the Rules of Juſtice, Truth; yea, and in the accounted order and method of it, to and when have done all, if that will not prevail, to commend it to the Witneſs of God in the Conſciences of all both of Friends and Enemies, thinking and believing it to be nothing leſs then Impiety and Perſecution, to affrighten any with Threats; for if there is nothing that ſhall hurt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am ſure no Puniſhment there. And again in pag. 25. <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. to his old ſtory, and continue in ſtill doting about their Wicked and Unjuſt Judgment, and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as if commiſſionated by the Quarterly Meeting to do what they did: To which there is no need toretnrn any other Anſwer to them then their own Paper, which plainly ſhows and proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that they had neither Order nor Commiſſion to do as they did, if you can or dare believe themſelves; but I have been both large and particular in the foregoing, though can hardly meet with ſuch their Ignorant Dotage, but to place a reproof upon it, pray read their Paper, and then judge of their Commiſſion, and whether <hi>O. S.</hi> to uſe his own words as in pag. 24. <hi>Hath not broke his own Head, by ſo contradicting himſelf?</hi> And further, as to his and their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Beſeeching Bowels,</hi> &amp;c. as in the foreſighted page, they are only words of Fraud, Craft and Deceit, as their Fruits makes appear, and that as if on purpoſe to deceive and beguile the unwary Reader, for how a more favourable Compariſon or Conſtruction, but that to like to the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> that after he hath Ravened upon and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Body, is obſerved, as its ſaid, to ſhed Tears and weep over the Head, nor indeed uſed to no other nor better end than as in pag. 25. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> than for me to deny my Teſtimony, rack my Conſcience, ſin againſt God, and hazard my Soul, ſeeing I had ſo often told them that I was ſo concern'd, and if any thing more or beſides this, no doubt, but for me to fall down, Beg, Beſeech, Pray and Intreat them that have ſo uſed and abuſed me, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and although have ſo done, as may ſay in too large a Degree, in my ſo far condeſcending in order unto it, yet have they nevertheleſs Refuſed and Denyed, as more at large in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and therefore I think I have well ſaid, as in the page cited by him, <hi>viz.</hi> That it rather beſpeaks the Scorn and Deteſtation of all, then any notice to be taken of it, by ſuch that cannot be thus Bowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172122:27"/>and Beſeeched out of their right Wits and Sences; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the Reader judge, whether ſuch Boweling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſerves any better Obſervation then I have made upon it: and although thus plain and tite upon them, for their Hanging ſo together and acting in ſuch Hypocriſie and Deceit, yet never dare to either ſay or think of them, or any of them, as that Heart-diſcerning Man <hi>J. Buy</hi> did of thoſe he and they account as Serpents, which was, that they hung together like a Company of Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (after a Frivolous and Crafty preamble about the Weakneſs and aggravting my Charges againſt the aforeſaid) he pretends to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Incounter and to prove them ſo.</p>
            <p>But a word or two further, to what he ſo fondly inſinuates concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Weakneſs of my Obſervations upon their ſaid Paper of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before I enter upon the replying to his leſs then a quarter, I cannot ſay by halfs, Comment upon my Ten Articles or Charges, as in pag. 25. on that Subject where (ſaith he) <hi>That which followeth next in</hi> A. B's. <hi>Book, is obſervations both generally and particularly, upon the Paper that we Seven gave as our Sence or Judgment, upon the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence without any Solid matter or fair Reaſoning, but a continual Juſtifing of himſelf by meer ſaying ſo, without Proof or Demonſtration, that I do not think that any Sober Man can read them without great diſlike,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And if ſo ſlender and weak, why did he not recite them, that the Reader might have Seen and have Judged for himſelf, but as it hath been ſo, its ſtill his way to impoſe ſuch a implicet Belief upon his over-credulous Reader, though no Sober or Diſcreet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whatſoever he or ſhe be, cannot, I think, but diſlike of ſuch his cunning Subtil Wiles and ways of deceitful Inſinuatings, and yet out of all the aforeſaid, that by his own Confeſſion taketh it up no leſs than ſome Eight pages, which is near the Sixth part of it, there being but Fifty in the whole Book, he undertakes to make Anſwer but to Two of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> and the <hi>Seventh,</hi> the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt inconſiderable of all. And Reader, pray obſerve how <hi>O. S.</hi> hath done the like in giving the Go-by to the Principal, as may ſay or moſt material of all, as I could mention in ſeveral and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Caſes, but in particular of that of <hi>James Lauels,</hi> in ſuch his Confuſed and Frantick like Carriage and Behaviour (yea, and that in the open Court, and before all the comers and goers there) as in pag. 7, 8. of my Epiſtle to the <hi>Cry,</hi> is more at large, nor yet in the caſe of <hi>W. Spickman</hi> neither, who alſo have pretended with the aforecited for, or as a Perſon prophetick, nor yet of himſelf and others (that in the midſt of our ſuch expoſing by <hi>T. C.</hi> and the reſt) had it nevertheleſs that ſevere Temper and Hardineſs of mind as to Preach
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172122:27"/>us, ſo Openly and Publickly there for ſuch <hi>Black Devils,</hi> or <hi>White,</hi> &amp;c. But to return to the foreintended, I think it not amiſs for to let the Reader ſee, ſo it be but in one or the firſt part or Branch of my ſaid obſervation, as in pag. 25. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> and by it (to uſe his own phraſe) for him to Judge of the reſt, my words being theſe. And now as to the matter in Charge againſt <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which were all of them true and no lye or falſhood in any one of them, neither any ſcruple or doubt in the leaſt ever ſhown or object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the truth of them, or any one of them: Was ever the like wicked, corrupt and unjuſt Judgment thus given forth before againſt any one, by Men under your Circumſtances, from the beginning of the World to this day, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Unto which ſhall add, that I think their's hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any other beſides <hi>O.S.</hi> that will account this an unfair way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, void of ſolid Matter, Proof and Demonſtration that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth as I may ſay, the main, the principal, and the whole of it all; for if thoſe my Charges againſt the aforeſaid, were all of them true (and allowed as ſuch, by their paſſing them over with ſilence) and no Lye or Falſhood in any one of them, neither any Scruple or doubt in the leaſt ever ſhown or objected as to the truth of them, or any one of them, then what have you been adoing all this while (ſeeing as before, Silence giveth conſent to the Truth of it) either in your ſaid Judgment, or otherways, then only as Men beating the Air, or rather worſe, by your thus indeavouring the acquitting of the Guilty, and by giving ſuch a Wicked, Corrupt and Unjuſt Judgment againſt the Guiltleſs and Innocent, which the like was ſcarce ever given before by Men, under your Circumſtances (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch ſerious as pretends) conſideration and weighing in the Light of Chriſt, your Lord, the ſence and judgment that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in pag. 10. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> ſince the Beginning of the World to this Day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And as to the <hi>firſt</hi> of the two Obſervations, which falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſecond Head, as in pag. 28. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> I having ſpoken to it before in my Anſwer to his Comment upon it, their is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for to further inlarge, ſhall therefore only enter upon my Anſwer to the <hi>Seventh,</hi> as in pag. 26 of his, <hi>Where he Cavelleth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at our delivering of our Sence</hi> viz. <hi>that until he be reconciled to his Bretheren, he ought not to offer his Gift upon God</hi>'s <hi>ALtar.</hi> Unto which may I not ſay as to that of the forecited, under the ſecond Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the greateſt piece of Folly, Weakneſs, and ridiculous Nonſence, I think, that ever any Man was enjoyned, and ſo ridiculous, the caſe conſidered, that it rather beſpeaks the Scorn and Deteſtation of all, than any notice to be taken of it.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:172122:28"/>
            <p>But if any ſhould object and ſay, <hi>But pray then what is the main, or chief of the matter you ſo often hint at and mean, and thus inſiſt upon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>W. L. J. B.</hi> &amp;c. ſtrong Wills and Imaginations, who by and through the ſame, have given me to juſt an occaſion of Offence. And if it ſhould be further Queried, though little cauſe for it, <hi>But pray how and wherein?</hi> My anſwer to them, as frequently and often hinted, is by ſuch their ſpiritual Pride, Lording, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I the Perſon for all that, that muſt and ſhall crave, ſeek and cry unto them that ſo offended me, for Reconciliation, Pardon and Forgiveneſs, but in a plainer or more familiar compariſon or ſimily thus, <hi>viz.</hi> I being earneſt and zealous for my Father's honour and attributes, and grieved at the breaking of his Laws and Precepts, theſe Men meeting with me in the way, have not only ſeized, but fallen upon, beaten, and fore wounded me for it; and yet for all this, will they in no ways be Friends and Reconciled, unleſs I will come, fall down, ſubmit, and cry to them for the Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of my Treſpaſs, the which I think not any, except <hi>O. S.</hi> and themſelves, that will account of it otherways, <hi>viz.</hi> than as before, the greateſt piece of Folly, Weakneſs, and ridiculous Nonſence as ever any Man was enjoyn'd, and to much like the dealings of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren towards him, for telling of his Viſions that the Lord had ſhewed him concerning the Day of Bowing and Humility, that they could no ways allow or bear to hear of, therefore ſold into <hi>Egypt</hi> he muſt and ſhall be for it, (and a Bond-man, though was born free. And as to that of the Altar, do ſay of it as I did before; and what hath <hi>O. S.</hi> offered in the leaſt, to either invalid or diſprove it?) That it is the firſt time I do believe that ever any one was forbidden the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of their Gifts upon God's Altar, and Chriſt be that Altar: Note, and Chriſt be that Altar, I mean under a Goſpel-Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And what do <hi>O. S.</hi> and others invite and gather unto, if not to him? and yet muſt they when they come, be ſtopped or forbidden to offer! And as to that Scripture cited by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23, 24. it only relates to the Jewiſh or outward Altar, as he that reads may ſee, or that built of Brick or Stone, and not of himſelf, the inward and ſpiritual Altar, as by the precedent and following doth moſt evidently appear, where our Saviour ſpeaking to the ſame import, ſaith, <hi>For I came not to deſtroy the Law,</hi> [Note, the Law] <hi>or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but to fulfil.</hi> And further, as in verſ. 18. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth paſs, one Jot or one Tittle ſhall in no ways paſs from the Law,</hi> (obſerve, from the Law) <hi>till all be fulfilled.</hi> And again in the following, <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſhall teach men ſo to do, ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdom of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:172122:28"/>God.</hi> And therefore whatever I did by Letter, or otherways in the forbidding of them, <hi>viz. W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> &amp;c. of the offering of their Gifts until reconciled, it was but a Simily, and a managing of them by their own methods: And put caſe I ſhould grant that I was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in it, as <hi>O. S.</hi> ſeems to be, yet I think it not to ſoon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, nor I hope to late to learn better; but the outward Altar and Offering is one thing, and the Inward or Spiritual is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the one but the Shadow or the Type, but the other the Antitype or Subſtance. And therefore if <hi>O. S.</hi> or any of them, do think or account otherways, may I not juſtly return upon them the Scripture cited by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. viz. <hi>Ye err, not knowing the Scripture nor the Power of God.</hi> Neither do I, or ever did deny the outward Altar to be God's Altar in its ſeaſon and time; but that which was added by me in this preſent caſe, was, <hi>And Chriſt be that Altar,</hi> &amp;c. But now to return to the Charges.</p>
            <p>The which, ſaith he, <hi>He divided into Ten Articles, of which the firſt is in their Arbitrary-like, over-ruling the Monthly Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. His proof for this is, that they poſitively affirmed, that a matter under debate at a Monthly Meeting in the firſt Month, 1690. ſhould not be made the act of the Meeting; and when ſo made and recorded, that afterwards they ſtill, as apparently, denyed it to be the Act of the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; <hi>This was it ſeemeth</hi> (ſaith <hi>O. S.) about treating with</hi> T. C. <hi>about opening the Meeting-Houſe-Doors, which</hi> T. C. <hi>and the reſt of the Seperates had wrongfully ſhut up; and</hi> A. B. <hi>in a forward, buſie mind, having got a few others to joyn with him therein, would needs be tempering (as I underſtand) with</hi> T. C. <hi>about opening of them, and would have done it in the Name of the Monthly-Meeting,</hi> (Pray obſerve, tho' <hi>W. L.</hi> the very Man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that was enjoyned it by the Friends that correſpond for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,) <hi>which</hi> W. L. (<hi>not</hi> J. B. <hi>for</hi> John Buy <hi>was not preſent at the Meeting, as appears by the Monthly-Meeting-Book) objected againſt, that if they would needs be medling in that matter, it might not be done as the Act of the Monthly-Meeting, but as their own act; and ſurely,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in a caſe of that importance; for it was as</hi> A. B. <hi>ſays, to deſire them to open the Doors freely, or upon refuſal, to offer them all their Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt, <hi>O. S.</hi> has again miſt the matter, by ſuppoſing what's falſe, and a Lye, for a Truth, a practice to common and frequent with him, for that it was not <hi>A. B.</hi> that in a forward or buſie mind either apart, or by getting others to joyn with him that did make the aforeſaid Propoſition, (though not to be condemned if he had) it being nothing other or more than what <hi>J. Buy</hi> and my ſelf was ſent, ordered and commiſſionated to do by the ſaid Meeting,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172122:29"/>and that long before, and did accordingly as ordered, as in <hi>Query</hi> 1. in my Book of <hi>Queries, Hidden Things revealed, &amp;c.</hi> And that in their publick Meeting for Worſhip, being the 21ſt of the 5th Mon. 1687. and on the Firſt Day of the Week, ſo zealous and earneſt were we for and in it, though ſince deſerted by the one, and denyed by the other. And if you would know, and can believe when you do, the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was not made by <hi>A. B.</hi> nor by any he had got to joyn with him, but by <hi>Andrew Hall,</hi> and by him alone, and that wholly and altogether, both unknown and unthought of by me, as them of the Meeting can witneſs; though it's to be noted, that if any thing that looks ſo much as like Peace, or that tends to it, is irkſom and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to him. To the ſecond, where he again inſinuates another Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by ſaying, <hi>That</hi> J. Buy <hi>was not preſent at the ſaid Meeting, and that it appear'd ſo by the Monthly Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt,</hi> I do affirm that he was there, as alſo that it was not done by <hi>A. B.</hi> and a few others, but by the Monthly-Meeting and their Order, and <hi>J. Buy, A. Hall,</hi> and <hi>D. Bullock,</hi> were alſo ordered and appointed by the aforeſaid to treat with <hi>T. C.</hi> and <hi>R. P.</hi> about it. [Note, that this was another, or ſecond offer, and done too by the Orders and Appointment of the ſaid Meeting.] and by which the untruth and uncertainty of their Book and Books, (and that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording where no Intreſt) as well as of themſelves, may be clearly ſeen and diſcern'd, therefore no great wonder if what <hi>O. S.</hi> propos'd for an Appeal at the Quarterly at <hi>Newbery,</hi> as hinted, as well as of the premis'd in their Monthly, be not Recorded, or to be found in them: So what hath he vaid or in the leaſt propos'd to either weaken or invalid my firſt Article or Charge againſt them, except Falſhood and Lyes will do it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then to the <hi>Second</hi> which is, <hi>Their paſſing ſuch a raſh and unchriſtian Sentence againſt him, as being a Man of a wrong Spirit, Brother to</hi> Bugg, <hi>and like to</hi> Rogers <hi>and</hi> Story; <hi>and if they have</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>judged him a Man of a wrong Spirit, he hath ſaved them the labour of proving it, having too evidently proved it himſelf by the work he hath imployed himſelf in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And what that work is, the Reader may eaſily judge to be my witneſſing and teſtifing againſt their Inſulting, Lording, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hath not both the Papiſt and other Perſecutors, accounted of ſuch as <hi>O S.</hi> has done of me, <hi>viz.</hi> as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, Contentious, Railers, Backſliders, Slanderers, Lyars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe Charity, as well as ſight and diſcerning herein ſeems much one and the ſame, ſeeing that inſtead of clearing them of the ſaid
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:172122:29"/>Charges, he hath wholly miſſed, and giveth the Go-by to it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof ſeeks rather to bury with Reproach and Calumnies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if all the matter of fact or Crime that you had to lay againſt <hi>W. R.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> was only for the ſame, the aforeſaid, and no other Cauſe, I am ready to believe that you have as much wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as its apparent you have done me.</p>
            <p>And as to the other part relating to <hi>T. C</hi>'s. meeting me, and thus accoſting, <hi>viz. Canker, go thy way Canker:</hi> It matters but little to me what <hi>T. C.</hi> or <hi>O. S.</hi> either hath or can ſay, or however falen in or joyned with him or them, as faſly accuſed, but what they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath or can prove. And this further, had I been ſo and ſuch a one, I might happily have been better eſteemed by both the one and the other. And if it ſhould be ask'd of <hi>O. S.</hi> or the reſt, Why what's the matter, the crime, his charge? or what hath <hi>A. B.</hi> done? What other Anſwer in Juſtice and Honeſty can they return, then only this, Why, he hath Charged <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> which we to Dearly Love, and to great infirmly to either hear or bear the hearing of any thing he hath Written or Spoken againſt them, as charging with Lording, Over-ruling, Pride, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the which although we are no way able to either acquit or clear them of it: yet notwithſtanding that we may do ſomething, and as much as we can or are able, we will return him Railing inſtead of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Cenſures inſtead of Argument; for what more further or other than this, in all and throughout the whole of his <hi>Reviler?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The third Article</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is againſt</hi> W.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>His Fourth Article</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is againſt</hi> W. L. <hi>and</hi> J. B. <hi>joyntly, falſly charging them with indeavouring to Diſmember him, and the tying up of his Tounge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which do return, in what manner and degree of the tying up of my Tounge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was intended, the Fruits of their work do to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently make appear; as firſt, in their Meetings for Buſineſs, if I ſpoke or offered but to ſpeak a word, however concern'd, no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is to be taken of it, nor anſwer to be given by any, no not in any Caſe, and more apparent in thoſe for Worſhip, by their ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and frequent breaking out againſt me, uncivil Interruption, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to be ſilent, and that it was not my place to Speak, as more at large in pag. 7, 8, 9. of the <hi>Cry;</hi> And what difference I pray betwixt tying up of the Tounge and binding the Conſcience in a Religious concern? and whether both (pretend what they will) be not plain apparent Perſecution, and as the Seed and Root of it, and whether bears not the Image and perfect Shape of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition in it's Degree, I ſhall leave the Impartial to Judge? as alſo, whether thoſe that were of the like mind, were not the firſt contrivers of, as well as center'd in no leſs than the uſe of the Gagg, and kindling of thoſe Cruel and Diſtructive Flames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the aforeſaid?</p>
            <p>The 5th Article, <hi>Their diſorderly breaking up and leaving of Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings before the Buſineſs depending had been near done; and when Matters have been juſt under debate amongſt us (for which he giveth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſeveral Inſtances) one of the</hi> 26. <hi>of</hi> 6. <hi>Month,</hi> 1690. <hi>when he laid theſe Charges againſt them, for which he refers to his Paper of Complaint; but that Paper of Complaint giveth no account of any ſuch Diſorderly or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct breaking up of that Meeting that I obſerv'd,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And who could help it if he did not, ſeeing it is ſo, and really and alone the Truth, and as the Reader may ſatisfie himſelf, if he pleaſe to Read the middle part of the firſt Paragraph in pag. 1. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. And what if it had not been there, their were other places and times Sufficient enough to prove it.</p>
            <p>And further, <hi>I think,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if Friends ſhould hold and continue their Meetings as long as ſuch Make-Bates would hold them in debate, they would find that more diſorderly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, though it were, as ſaid, in the midſt of their Buſineſs, and when Matters have been juſt under debate by all, which it's moſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172122:30"/>evidently ſeen, that whether order or diſorder, it's all one and alike to him, and they Juſtify'd and Excus'd in their diſorders by one, and him that pretends to be ſo much for them, and ſo thereby have rather confirmed and made party with them in it, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Blaming or Seeking their excuſe, which may be taken as a double Confirmation of their Truth and Verity; yea, and tho' have made ſuch a manifeſt diſtraction by their reſolute Ways and Wills, that they have even left the very Room where the reſt of Friends have been in their Buſineſs, and have begun to ſettle and go forward with theirs in another; and again after a very little while, have wheeled about by a back Way, and come into the ſame Meeting again; yet all both grave and profound in the ſence and view of <hi>O. S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>He giveth another inſtance,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of a pretended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly breaking up of a Meeting in the</hi> 5th. <hi>Month</hi> 1691. <hi>which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no more then the former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How ſo? when the firſt, was in the 6th Month, 1690. and the other in the 5th Month, 1691. near eleven Months difference. And what other proof doth he expect, than the Name of the Perſons and Place, when and where acted, I cannot tell, neither do I know; and ſeeing that they the Parties ſo charged be thus Silent, and ſtand mute, with reſpect to their own Defence, it's none of the leaſt Demonſtration of their Truth, and it's being ſo; And as to the varying, if their be a Diſconcurrence, as before, with reſpect to the dates, may I hope both Eaſily and Reaſonablly be excuſed in me, that had my moſt perfect Copies and Papers taken or kept from me, loſt, or pretended to be loſt, as in pag. 18. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. But what is that material or to the purpoſe, ſince accounts not the thing it ſelf, as either evil Crime or Matters of Fact; and if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Witneſs, or plead Ignorance of thoſe Diſorders, the whole Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, who at one time or another have ſeen and believed, can give witneſs of its Truth, which he queſtions not, but quibbles.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>His Sixth Article,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Is their incouraging and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at leaſt, if not firſt projecting, as he conceives ſeveral Papers drawn up and ſigned againſt him, &amp;c. This is very idle and ſilly,</hi> ſaith <hi>O. S. for he grounds their projecting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of thoſe Papers but upon his own conception, but for there incouraging and promoting them, he offers not ſo much as that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt,</hi> although I placed in ſuch eaſie and modeſt manner, (yet I might, and could have been more Poſitive and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in it) as in pag. 8. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> where I have told them that it was drawn up at a private Meeting held at <hi>J. Buy's,</hi> and in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172122:31"/>which I was Poſitive, and obſerve <hi>O. S.</hi> hath not in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as certainly inform'd that <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> were both of them preſent at the ſaid Meeting. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they would have Signed it too, had not ſome Judged it not proper, they being Parties; and if all the forementioned Inſtances and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be not reaſonable and enough to induce one to Believe that they were both the Projectors and Promoters of them, I ſhall be contented to be thought as idle and ſilly as they count me. And as to the Second, of their incouraging and promoting them, ſaith he, <hi>He offers not ſo much as that, as little worthas it is.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely <hi>O. S.</hi> is fallen into a Dream, and Groaping as one that is benighted.</p>
            <p>But to be yet more plain and particular in it, <hi>A. Hall</hi> was one of them that refuſed or deny'd to Sign the aforeſaid, when carried about to get Hands to it, as may be further proved, if occaſion be; but <hi>O. S.</hi> need not thus ſeek to Create ways to excuſe or evade it, ſeeing in the concluſion of his anſwer to the ſaid Article, he has both Own'd and Juſtify'd them in it, and the thing it ſelf by ſaying, <hi>But if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Signing of thoſe Papers (yet ſo long as thoſe Papers contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but what is true) what evil had they done in that?</hi> But how idle he is in it, ſhall leave the Reader to Judge, that accounts it not in the leaſt as matter of fact, though through and by the means of which, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch their Dark and Underhand-dealing, they have as apparent thus rent and torn us to peices; and in the which he has but only beg'd the Queſtion, and as ſilly to uſe his own towards me, to ſo take and receive as may ſay for Truth the main and matter in Controverſie, without more or further proof to it, but it may be <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> have ſaid it, and what need of any more, and yet what evil is this with him or them. Oh thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver, countenancer and incourager of Strife and Debate, what will be thy Reward for this work in the end!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His ſeventh Article,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is their cauſing of great diſcords and diſtraction in our publick Meetings for Worſhip, by breaking up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving them in the time of his Teſtimony and Prayer.</hi> Note, the which <hi>O. S.</hi> doth not in the leaſt either deny or ſeek to excuſe, but tells of Diſcords and Smiting, and all the Diſorders aſſign'd, is only my ſo appearing, and of Smiting, you have only his Word for it, for he tells neither how, when, or wherein, nor yet mentions any one Particular, that I have obſerved, in all this Noiſe and Clamour be has made, therefore may I not return again upon him in his own Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> That Generals ſerve beſt for Slanderers to hide
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:172122:31"/>under. And concerning my Teſtimony, thus further adds, <hi>Which was his Teſtimony indeed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not Truth</hi>'s, <hi>and therefore was by Friends in Truth teſtified againſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But that not my own, but Truth's Teſtimony, both the nature, matter and manner, I hope will give Teſtimony of it's ſelf, for ſurely hardly any one, except <hi>O. S.</hi> and his Aſſociates, that is ſo hardy and wilfully Blind that cannot or doth not ſee it, eſpecially ſuch that have Read and Conſider'd my Articles and Charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and what they are, as Pride, Lording, Inſulting, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for which my Mouth is to be ſtopped, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a <hi>Smiter, Diſturber</hi> one <hi>of a wrong Spirit, out of unity, Brother to</hi> Bugg, <hi>and like to</hi> Rogers <hi>and</hi> Story. And then back again to there Law of force or unrevokable Argument, or what elſe can I term it, <hi>viz.</hi> their Wicked and Unjuſt Judgment, <hi>this being,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>after Judgment had been given againſt him,</hi> &amp;c. Surely he thinks he has hit it now, he has ſaid enough, and that their is neither need nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any more; And all this it ſeems as would have thought for my ſuch Contention and Reflection on faithful Friends, but ſhall leave others that Read not <hi>O. S.</hi> to judge of the Contentions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how faithful by their Fruits not his or any one's words, as alſo do call to both him, them, and all Men that ever heard me or was there, when at any time I opened my Month, that hath heard any ſuch wicked, vile, hard-hearted, cruel and mercileſs Words or Expreſſions, come out of it towards or concerning any, or either of them, or of any Man elſe; no, God forbid, for my Heart hath been kept and ſtood more in awe and fear of him, then as before, to frequent and to often have had occaſion to ſpeak and write of their's, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Divil, Dogg, Lyon, Swine, Vulter, Bear; baſe Abortive, Illigetimate Brat, who have made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, and whoſe Conſcience is ſear'd as with a hot Iron, and for whom is reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever, betraying Judas</hi>'s, &amp;c. As more at large in pag. 20. of the <hi>Cry.</hi> Oh, how can or dare this hardned Man, or any of the reſt, thus charge or criminate other for Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reflection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are found thus idlely evil, foul &amp; outragious themſelves, and that beyond the bounds of all Mortality or Civility as amongſt Men: Oh be aſtoniſhed, and bluſh for ſhame, ye men of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and pride.</p>
            <p>Again, in the cloſe of this Article, meaning of me, <hi>Then he cometh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the other three, viz.</hi> W. Spikeman <hi>and the two Women, for no other cauſe ſo far as I ſee,</hi> ſaith <hi>O. S. but that he might thence take occaſion to throw ſome of his Dirt upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> From whence it may be obſerved, that he counteth them both clear and clean enough, as with reſpect to themſelves. The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:172122:32"/>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of which hath been charged, and that by his own Children, as before, with Barbarous Severity towards his Wife and them (and not by <hi>A. B.</hi> or any invention of his.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> of being with Child before ſhe was Married, the laſt as a profeſſed <hi>Quaker,</hi> and that for nigh this twenty Years, and permitted for a Preacher amongſt them too, that is ſo unfaithful even in the beginning part of our viſible Profeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the plain and ſingle Language, therefore think there's no occaſion for my caſting of more Dirt, where ſo much and to much before; and I hope the Reader will place his Remarks, and alſo obſerve how ready and dextrous <hi>O. S.</hi> is to perſonate and eſpouſe their caſe, without the leaſt Sentence, Cenſure, or Crimination of wrong Spirit, or out of Unity; ſurely men of Sobriety will bluſh to hear or ſee them, though <hi>O. S.</hi> is ſo double-eyed and dark-ſighted that he cannot.</p>
            <p>And then goes on and tells of <hi>E. B</hi>'s <hi>Blameleſs Converſation,</hi> though a Perſon under the aforeſaid foul and evil Circumſtances, <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding permitted and allowed to ſo oppoſe and interrupt</hi> (and praiſed too for it, I do not queſtion) <hi>the which I charge upon her as a ſecond mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, if ſhe hath owned and repented of the firſt.</hi> And to that of <hi>Ann Moore,</hi> thus further, <hi>If any</hi> (ſaith <hi>O. S.) after ſo long profeſſion of Truth, is not come ſo far as to ſpeak Plain Language, ſuch a one is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be blamed: But yet</hi> A. B. <hi>is more to blamed, who after a longer time of profeſſion, is ſo far gone from it, if ever he was come to Plain-dealing, as to deal abuſively and falſly by others, as his late Book makes appear.</hi> And that is all his Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>Is not this both an Honeſt and Ingenious proof, and ſufficient, do you think in ſo large and ſo great a Charge, wherein I am concerned both as a Man and a Chriſtian, for to only tell as his late Book makes appear? Surely he has cauſe enough to be aſhamed, if he had any in him: And yet to tell, <hi>that Generals ſerve beſt to Slanderers to hide under.</hi> But that general of his, is but ſuch a ſcrap of one, if may account it ſo much, as that it rather diſcovereth, then any ways hides or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures him; and if <hi>A. B</hi>'s late Book hath ſo diſcovered him, how laviſh is <hi>O. S.</hi> of others Purſes, to run up his Reader to ſix pence charges upon his. And as to my Dealing, that it hath been plain and honeſt, I can and do appeal to all and every one that is honeſt and impartial, that I have had to do withal as a Man or Chriſtian. And ſo dare not he, (and to mention but one caſe inſtead of many, let him remember himſelf of the ſubtil Wiles and cunning Craft that he uſed towards the Friends of <hi>Newberry,</hi> he elſewhere mentions to his defence, when he removed from <hi>Boxford</hi> thither, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Call. But what ſhould I mention or enter into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, in a caſe ſo obvious and manifeſtly known by Friends of that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:172122:32"/>place, ſave in one only, and that as with reſpect to the Houſe that they had taken for him. And how his Actions, if not pretended Call, went out like the Snuff of a Candle that leaves a ſtink behind it: If he deſire more, he may have it in the next, otherways but to plain both in Heart, Tongue, and Dealing, to be fit for your turn and uſe, as more at large in my Book, <hi>Hidden things revealed,</hi> &amp;c. And by which the Reader, to uſe his own to me, may judge of the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> At what an eaſie rate both as with reſpect to Religion as well as Civils, men are and may be thus expoſed by ſuch ſilly and reaſonleſs Arguments, and yet for all this, <hi>J. B.</hi> a Man as ready and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted as himſelf, eſpecially at judging at heart and inward part diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, told <hi>J. W.</hi> a Friend of <hi>London</hi> of that, excepting in that which related to the difference, <hi>None could ſay Black was my Eye,</hi> or to this effect; and how black in the other, he that runs may read, ſeeing that I have witneſs'd againſt nothing in him, them, or the reſt, but what is ſo black, and to black too, if Spiritual Pride, Lording, Inſulting, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can or may be accounted ſo, and by which their Sence, Diſcerning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be alſo obſerved, that cenſure and judge ſo apparently contrary one to the other.</p>
            <p>And then proceedeth, <hi>In the other part of the Charge,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to</hi> W. Spikeman, <hi>he is both envious and unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c. And yet three or four Lines lower he makes as if but <hi>John Veals</hi> charge, and he the only author and alledger of it, <hi>and that the aforeſaid brought it in a Paper</hi> (ſaith <hi>O. S.) as he finds it by the Monthly-Meeting-Book the</hi> 26th <hi>of the</hi> 5th <hi>Month,</hi> 1692. But how theſe two can hang together, I ſhall leave the Impartial to judge; and upon what an eaſie rate I am judged for both envious and unjuſt, though acted and done by another, as by his own Confeſſion. And then goes on and tells how that the ſaid Meeting had ordered <hi>Andrew Hall, Daniel Bullock, John Buy,</hi> and <hi>John Thorne,</hi> to hear and examine the matter at <hi>Daniel Bullocks</hi> Houſe; and having heard and examined the matter on both ſides as fully as they could, they made report thereof to the next Monethly Meeting, and then annexeth to the foregoing a kind of a Certificate, ſigned by <hi>D. Bullock, A. Hall,</hi> and <hi>J. Buy,</hi> and who therein ſignifie to the like import, viz. <hi>That upon the beſt Inquiry that they could make, that they did not find</hi> W. Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>was guilty of the ſaid Complaint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which do return, that it may be that they were ſo juſt as to ask the Perſon charged, whether he were guilty or no, and thought it to be enough too and ſufficient in the caſe.</p>
            <p>But what Inquiry I pray? What hearing and examining the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on both ſides, and as fully as could be too, when the Witneſs not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:172122:33"/>there, the Witneſs not heard, the Witneſs not examined? Oh, how to the ruin of Juſtice and ſhame of Religion, have theſe Men done and acted amongſt you, and that under the notion and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meeters and Meeting, hearing, examining, and that on both ſides, and that as fully as you could: Oh, I ſay, would not ſome we account as Heathens or Infidels, both bluſh, be aſhamed, and ſpit and waſh their Mouths after it.</p>
            <p>And further, ſay they, <hi>We underſtand that</hi> J. Veal <hi>brought forth this Charge by the Inſtigation of others.</hi> And if ſo, happily by ſuch that had leſs Envy, and more love to Truth and Juſtice then themſelves, it being evident they had little or none to either.</p>
            <p>And as to the Certificate of <hi>E. S.</hi> following and annexed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her dear Husband, the which ſhe begins with a Lye, by ſaying, <hi>that</hi> A.B. <hi>in his Book, printed</hi> 1695. <hi>hath charged</hi> W. S. <hi>her Husband with barbarous Severity towards his Wife and Children.</hi> For that it's not ſo, nor none of <hi>A.B</hi>'s Charge, but the charge of one of their own Children, as in p. 9. of the <hi>Cry;</hi> and <hi>O. S.</hi> no doubt has ſeen it ſo, only Ignorance with him in this, as in the reſt, is to be the Mother of Devotion: And yet for all this, in the concluſion thus inſinuates, viz. <hi>Judge now Reader, if</hi> A. B. <hi>be not a bad Man for thus publiſhing the aforeſaid?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before do return any farther in Anſwer to her, I do query of <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> whether the ſaid <hi>E. S.</hi> be a Woman of ſuch credit with them, and amongſt her Neighbours, as to have her Name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted thus in publick to a Certificate, or indeed to or in any thing elſe, to thus paſs as authentick amongſt you, one I ſay, of ſo mean and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner of Life and Converſation, for that (as charged) ſhe is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true nor juſt in her way of Trade &amp; manner of dealing at home, nor much better when abroad. For was it not told us, as alledged by ſome of her Neighbours, that ſhe ſtole Corn out of the Cock or Sheaf, when in the Field and a Leeſing amongſt them, and the which was teſtifyed unto us as ſo, and for Truth, as you both know, at a Meeting appointed (as I remember) on purpoſe for the Hearing of a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>E. H.</hi> and her ſelf, and therefore may I not return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him (that ſeeming ſerious Man <hi>W. L.</hi>) in his own Language, what he formerly had ſaid of another in the like Caſe. I believe leſs blameable in Life, as well as nearer related, which was, that thoſe the aforeſaid pleaded for or belonged unto, would not ſo much as touch the ſaid party with a pair of Tongs: <hi>W. L.</hi> knoweth who I mean, but to ſerve their ends and intereſt by them. But again, if her Husband now ſo dear, the worſt that I wiſh them that it may continue; for if true, as her own Child have told and affirmed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:172122:33"/>ſhe was not ſo dear to him, if ſhe was, the more unworthy Man he. But to return by all what I have ſaid, the Reader may ſee what Tools and Inſtruments they are forc'd to make uſe of to ſign Certificates when put to it, and thus at a Streight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And no doubt but there was ſeveral more of the like ſort amongſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, nameleſs One and Twenty he ſigns in the behalf of, as in p. 14. of his, <hi>A Reviler, &amp;c.</hi> But more of this, and ſuch their Paper and Certificate ſigning when I come to that of <hi>Charlon,</hi> given on the behalf of <hi>O.S.</hi> and ſigned by Relations only. I could ſay much more of <hi>W. S.</hi> and his Wife, and the Diſorderlineſs of his Family, as obſerved and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by his Neighbours, and a great deal too, but I think it not worth my while to ſpend time and foul my Fingers and Paper about it. And one thing more about their Certificate ſigning, as in p. 9. and the 14. of his, <hi>A Reviler, &amp;c.</hi> in the caſe of <hi>W. L.</hi> which intended to have ſpoke to afore, how it may be alſo obſerv'd what a Work and a Buſſel they made, with what fencing and defence they beforehand prepared, in order to the managing of the matter, and carrying on their Clandeſtine and under-hand deſigns, in order to beſpeak his Innocency, whom both Truth and Juſtice doth condemn; for had it not been time, and time enough for him and them (if they had been void of beguiling Crafts) to have given in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing Teſtimony or ſign'd Certificates on <hi>W. L</hi>'s behalf, when they ſaw that in Juſtice, and according to Truth he deſerv'd it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>His Eighth Article</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as in</hi> p. 31. <hi>againſt</hi> W. L. <hi>and</hi> J.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though ſhall undertake and prove, and that in particular, in the following, that they did it to one, and he none of the meaneſt, that was out of unity with them, notwithſtanding their ſuch feigned and pretended ſence and diſcerning, and that in the caſe when one <hi>John Anſlow</hi> was here, whom they numbred among the Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and a Ringleader too; but it's to be noted, that it was before that they knew his Name, ſo likewiſe to be obſerved, that their diſcerning is more by Name than any ſence of them otherways: But of this more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172122:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>hereafter. But to the <hi>first,</hi> that it is an open and publick Standard of oppoſition, is not denyed by him, but what the occaſion, or for what that oppoſition, no other Reaſon is aſſigned by the tendency of his Argument, than as only being one out of Unity; and I pray you for what ſo out of Unity, except for teſtifying againſt that in him and them, which is not only out of Unity with the Spirit of Truth, but all honeſt and ſincere Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> their Pride, Lording, Over-ruling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that it is an irreverant Practice in all caſes, I mean as with reſpect to our publick and Chriſtian Aſſemblies, is apparent; and he hath not offered any thing to the contrary, and more eſpecially in this caſe of mine, being only for the Reaſon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; for if they have any other ought or charge againſt me, than only for teſtifying againſt the aforeſaid groſs and notorious Evils, why do they not bring them forth, and let the World know what they be? And whatever was my Practice formerly towards thoſe, I accounted Seperates, yet when I come to ſee it to be an Evil, it would be a double one to do it as its uſual and frequent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and them, <hi>viz.</hi> to go on and perſiſt in it; neither do I care how publick my Recantation be, when conſcious that I have been in a fault, as in pag. 12. of my Book of Queries, <hi>Hidden things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> &amp;c. more at large, where I thus ſay in Query 15.

And as to the other part, in his charging me with joyning with thoſe he and the reſt counts Seperates, he doth but continue his abuſe towards me, as before, for that there was no other joyning, or intention of joyning with the aforeſaid, then what was adviſed unto and endeavoured by <hi>G.

            <p>Though <hi>O. S.</hi> has been thus ſhort in his truely ſtating of it, leaſt he ſhould thereby the more diſcover his own Weakneſs as well as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:172122:34"/>theirs; for is an act of Charity evil in it ſelf, if ſhould grant that the Perſon acting in it, were not other ways ſo good as they ought, or could wiſh they were, although as cited in the ſaid Charge, as in p. 9. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> that they had yet nevertheleſs took of thoſe whom I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they did not own as Members of their Meeting. And as to the other relating to the Caſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> have both heard and been credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inform'd that the Friends of <hi>London,</hi> had both received and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken towards it, of other well diſpoſed and Chriſtian minded People, though neither call'd nor reputed as <hi>Quakers,</hi> and was it not rather a manifeſt token of the hardneſs of their Hearts and him, in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of them in it, in being ſo injurous towards the Poor Sufferers, upon ſo trivial and ſmall an occaſion as a private Pett, and no cauſe for that neither towards me, except for being ſo plain, and telling them the Truth, though notwithſtanding as in the aforeſaid of the <hi>Cry,</hi> it was both taken and with mine the Contribution of ſeveral others, and well excepted of to by the Friends of <hi>London,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Collectors of it, Men of as quick diſcerning and of far more Prudence then themſelves; and then to thus Weakly and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly concludes <hi>what reaſon had he to expect they ſhould take his Mony, when as in his ſecond Article he ſays they told him they ſaw him to be a Man of a wrong Spirit.</hi> But I think that <hi>O. S</hi>'s. actions neither in Spirit nor in Purſe doth intitle him to be accounted as one of a Right.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>His</hi> 10th <hi>and laſt Article of his Charge is againſt</hi> J.B. <hi>in perticular for his Wicked and moſt Blaſphemouſly affirming, that he did ſee my inſide, as likewiſe that he diſcern my Heart and inward parts, which Wicked, Proud and Preſumptious words of his, I do not look upon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>or can conceive to be at all leſs or other then plain or apparent Blaſphemy, and taking to himſelf the Power and Attributes only and alone, proper and due to the immortal God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which do Anſwer, Where is the Man, or who is the Woman, except <hi>O. S.</hi> and himſelf, that either conceives or believes otherways of them. Again, ſaith <hi>O. S.

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it, I do think if I had harped upon it in every Line and make a greater noiſe about it, there was no more noiſe then cauſe, for both, he being the firſt Man in the World that ever I read or heard of, that was ſo preſumptious as to give forth or paſs ſuch an aſſertion, except Ranters or Atheiſts that care not what they ſay. And yet for all that <hi>O. S.</hi> will venture at it, and under take to prove and that from the Scripture, that their were others that had the like
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:172122:35"/>gift of diſcerning, and the Scriptures he cites for it are thoſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> the 1ſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> the 9th and 19 ver. <hi>Pſalms</hi> the 5th and the 9th. <hi>Acts</hi> the 5th. 3 and 4 verſes, the 8th. and 21. The 1 <hi>Corinth</hi> the 12th. and the 10th. ver. <hi>Pſalms</hi> the 5th. and the 9th. <hi>Acts</hi> the 5th. 3 and 4 verſes the 8th. and 21. The 1 <hi>Corinth</hi> the 12th. and the 16th. verſe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to the firſt, where <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul, Hearken, and I will tell thee all that is in thy Heart;</hi> which proves not the point at all, unleſs he could have alſo proved that he did it by a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of diſcerning, for that <hi>Samuel</hi> might tell <hi>Saul</hi> all that was in his Heart, and that no otherways than he had been told it, &amp; given him as his Errand or Meſſage from the Lord, whether by Viſion, Angels, or vocal Voice; and that it is not reaſonable to think or believe that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpoke it any otherways, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from Chap. 16. verſ. 6. when the Lord ſent him to anoint one of the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> to be King in the room of <hi>Saul,</hi> for that when the aforeſaid were come before him, and he looking upon <hi>Elihab,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord's anointed is before me? but the Lord ſaid, Look not on his Countenance, or on the heighth of his Stature, for the Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth, for Man looketh on the outward appearance</hi> (the Hebrew as in the Margent, <hi>On the Eyes) but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi> But if the Prophet had been as conceited as <hi>J. B.</hi> is of himſelf, no doubt but he would have retorted back, and ſaid, Ay, but I cannot only ſee his Heart, but diſcern it, yea, and his inwards parts too. And as to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 5.9. it proves no further or other diſcerning in <hi>David</hi> than the forecited hath in <hi>Samuel,</hi> and that is only from the outward appearance, or rather as Chriſt ſaith, viz. <hi>That the Tree is known by his Fruits;</hi> for ſpeaking their of his Enemies, he ſaith in plain, <hi>That their is no faithfulneſs in their Mouths, they flatter with their Tongues.</hi> And is this any other than by the outward appearance or fruits? The other, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. and verſ. 3. is in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife, which proves no more than the other, unleſs he had alſo proved that the way whereby the Apoſtles knew that they had ſo kept back part of their Poſſeſſions, was by the Spirit of diſcerning, and not by outward Information. The other <hi>Acts</hi> 8.21. far leſs than either of them, it is in the caſe of <hi>Simon</hi>'s offering the Apoſtles Money, in order to his purchaſing the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which was ſuch evil Fruits, and manifeſtly ſo, even to the outward appearance, which occaſioned the Apoſtle in verſ. 23. to ſay, <hi>I perceive</hi> (Note, Perceive) <hi>thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. The laſt is out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. where the Apoſtle treating of thoſe extraordinary <hi>gifts of the Spirit</hi> that they and they only were endowed withal, that were the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of the Goſpel; ſaith, viz. <hi>To one is given the gift of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to another Prophecy, to another diſcerning of Spirits, to another
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:172122:35"/>divers kinds of Tongues,</hi> now I do confeſs that if <hi>J. B.</hi> or <hi>O. S.</hi> can prove or demonſtrate that either of thoſe gifts, <hi>viz</hi> either of working of Miracles, ſpeaking with divers Tongues or ſeveral Languages, or the interpretation of Tongues, or the gift of healing be proper, or hath been practiſed by us or any in our days. I ſhall and will readily both conclude and grant that he hath proved the thing deſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath given a further or more ſecret way of diſcerning then by the outward appearance or Fruits.</p>
            <p>And now having ſhewed the Reader both the impertinency of the Scriptures cited by <hi>O. S.</hi> and his Inference from them, I intend in the next place to ſhew and prove, and that in too plain and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes and Inſtances, whereby it is apparent that <hi>J. B.</hi> hath no ſuch Spirit of diſcerning of the inſide of the Heart or inward parts either, and then ſhall indeavour to prove from plain and evident Scriptures, that ſuch a way and manner of diſcerning as he the ſaid <hi>J. B.</hi> hath thus proudly taken and aſſumed to himſelf, is only and alone proper, due and peculiar unto God. And therefore one of his <hi>Attributes.</hi> And that the ſaid <hi>J.B.</hi> by his ſo taking or aſſuming the ſame unto himſelf, hath thereby committed no leſs than plain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Blaſphemy; though before, I was ſo modeſt as only to ſay, which I look upon or conceived it to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which take as followeth; ſome time ago, and before the Old Meeting-houſe Doors were ſhut up, there came a Friend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to viſit us, whoſe Name was <hi>John Anſlow,</hi> (as hinted before) the which without any ſcruple, the leaſt doubt or miſtruſt concerning him (that I could in the leaſt perceive) was received, owned and allowed of alſo, both by <hi>J. B.</hi> and the reſt of them, (and if any, it was but becauſe they could not at firſt tell who he was) and aforeſaid accounted not only for a good Friend, but one in Unity too in the Morning Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and his Teſtimony likewiſe approved of as both freſh and living, both Hats off, and ſtanding up too at his Prayers; But yet in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when they had learned his Name, then both their Seats and Hats on again; as to all others when they know them to be ſuch, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth for wrong or bad Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I pray where was now the Heart and Inward diſcerning Part of <hi>W.L. J.B.</hi> or any the reſt of them? a fooliſh, idle, ridiculous Imagination and Fable, and yet <hi>O. S.</hi> you ſee, and the Seven, have near as much pretended to it in ſuch their ſerious Waitings in the Light of Chriſt our Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is in the eaſe I mentioned before, concerning the Pride and Imperiouſneſs of <hi>W. L.</hi> when the Friends for the County ſent down by their Letter to the Friends here, to Vote for ſuch Men
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:172122:36"/>for our Burgeſſes in Parliament, that we thought might be the moſt likely to do good in their places, and the which ſaid Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed and ſent to me, I firſt told and imparted the matter to <hi>J. B.</hi> on the Night before, and who ſeemed to be well pleas'd, and approv'd of the ſame, but in the Morning, the next day after he had ſpoken and conferr'd with <hi>W. L.</hi> about it, he was quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, and his Mind and diſcerning chang'd, and became as much turn'd againſt it as <hi>W. L.</hi> could be; and by the way, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo obſerve what a Sence of Sight and diſcerning theſe Men do pretend unto, inſomuch that they can both ſee and diſcern more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and beyond the aforeſaid, though the moſt Ancient and Grave amongſt Friends, that ſhall undertake either to council or adviſe them.</p>
            <p>And having thus plainly ſhewn you that <hi>J. B.</hi> is ſo far from the diſcerning of the Hearts and inward parts of others, that he neither knows, can, nor is able to diſcern his own. I ſhall in the next place cite thoſe Scriptures that prove the aforeſaid way of diſcerning, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Heart and inward parts, as only and alone proper and peculiar unto God, and then I ſhall leave the Reader to judge whether <hi>J. B.</hi> hath not ſpoken both plain and apparent Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, by aſſuming the aforeſaid to himſelf (though ſo light or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial as <hi>O. S.</hi> accounts them) that is, truly and alone the peculiar attributes proper and due alone unto the immortal God himſelf; as alſo ſhall appeal whether the matter be ſo light, he flouting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counts I have made ſuch a noiſe about. The firſt from <hi>Jeremy</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, I try the Reins</hi> (note, as an Appellation alone proper and due unto himſelf) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Oh! let wickedneſs of the Wicked come to an end,</hi> (and ſo ſaith my Soul with his) <hi>but eſtabliſh the juſt, for thou the righteous God tryeſt the Heart and Reins, Prov.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 3. the fining pot is for Silver, and the Furnace for Gold, but the Lord tryeth the Heart, from whence it may be obſerved, that although by the cunning and curious Arts of Men, both the Silver and the Gold may be tryed, and the Droſs ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them; yet that they, by all their Art, though never ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or hidden, can neither try nor diſcern the Heart of Man, but Lord, and he alone, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 24. and they prayed and ſaid, Thou Lord that knoweſt the Hearts of all Men, ſhew whether of theſe Two thou haſt choſen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Obſerve thee, which they need not to have been ſo earneſt or ſo much concerned in the matter, if they had been as ſharp and as ready at Heart and inward parts, diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as <hi>J. B.</hi> pretended to, <hi>Romans</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 27. and he that ſearcheth the Heart knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:172122:36"/>will of God, I could add more Proofs to the truth of my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I do think what have cited, are enough and ſufficient; let him account of them as in p. 32. for ſuch wicked proud and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Words, or what he will, the matters deep, he had need be aware. And as to that other ſcoffing flout of his in p. 33. of his, <hi>A Reviler, &amp;c.</hi> cited out of p. 26. of the <hi>Cry, viz.</hi> by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that there appears ſo little Wit in me, as to ſay that there ſeems but little ſubſtance in them, <hi>viz.</hi> my Charges againſt <hi>W.L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> in the which I ſhall leave the truly conſcious and impartial to judge, when they have well conſider'd of it, as ſtated in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and beſides he hath not dealt fairly nor Chriſtianly by me, by his ſo citing only a piece or part of my Words, and letting alone and leaving out of the reſt, as if he did it on purpoſe to ridicule me, by making them Nonſence and Confuſion, that ſo he may with the fairer gloſs deceive and beguile his Readers, and load me with ſuch his frequent Scoffs and Jears, by his ſo importing as if my Capacity of the ſmalleſt Size, one of as little Wit as in p. 33. ſuch a ſilly one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo in p. 37. of his, <hi>A Reviler,</hi> where reciting what I had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the caſe of <hi>Dorothy Hall,</hi> relating to the incurable wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he takes occaſion to joak thus upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the incurable wound that they ſpeak of in their Heads, and that it hath diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd both their Brains. But as informed concerning the aforeſaid <hi>D. K.</hi> and that by her own Siſter that was with her in the time of her Weakneſs, and untill her departure out of this World, that from her Head it went lower and fixed nothing ſhort of her Heart, and that it proved no leſs then the occaſion of her Death, and that which ſhe expreſſed to thoſe that were about her, but a little time before her Deceaſe; and it were better if <hi>O. S.</hi> were ſo truly ſerious as to turn his Flours into Tears, for it prov'd not a jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter unto her. But to return to what I ſaid, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the littleneſs of the ſubſtance that was in their Charges, it was but in the way of returning their own, back upon themſelves; my words, as truly cited, being theſe as apparent in p. 26. of <hi>the Cry, viz.</hi> whereas they ſay there appeareth but little of ſubſtance in them, my Anſwer to it is, and if ſo, then the leſs to be blam'd, but you have laid neither little, nor any at all upon them.</p>
            <p>And then in the next Paragraph in the ſame Page, I come ſaith he to that part of his Book which is levelled more directly and particularly at me, as in page 33, where he ſays, ſeeing that <hi>O. S.</hi> one of the aforeſaid unjuſt Judges hath taken a freſh occaſion thus to run out againſt me through ſome Offence he hath taken at my late Book of Queries; it hath come into my thoughts to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:172122:37"/>diſcover and manifeſt him, and that in his Plain and naked Shape, <hi>&amp;c. Anſwer;</hi> As to my further diſcovering him as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, I think I have done it, and that ſufficiently too, but if in any thing I have been too ſhort, I intend to do it more fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done with him, and as to the Scripture cited out of p. 44. of <hi>the Cry, viz.</hi> report, and we will report it relates to falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only, and not to honeſt Friends, as he would falſly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, but to himſelf and the reſt, and not to ſuch as mine of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that were and are true ones, and therefore as the Proverb is, <hi>Truth may be blam'd but not ſham'd,</hi> ſo the Shame will and muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly return upon himſelf, which he ſeeks to affix on <hi>A. B.</hi> and as to his further frivilous and needleſs ſtory about my former Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Unity with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The which in the beſt and ſtricteſt Sence was but my miſtake of him, for, as I told the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before that I was always doubtful that he was treacherous, as ſince I found him, and that in a double Sence, as clear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently manifeſt by the foregoing matter, and more to follow in its Courſe. And further, as to what I ſaid relating to his Malice and Bitterneſs, and of its being inherent to his Nature, I need not I think ſay any more to it, ſeeing as cited, his Actions are Evidence and Proof ſufficient to it, and in the caſe, and I think I have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be as charged (though he ſeems ſo offended at it) and that not only from his Mouth and Pen, but the relation and account of others, and as before, wherein too ſhort ſhall mend it in the following.</p>
            <p>And then proceeding, ſaith, the occaſion he here takes for his particular cavills at me, is for my returning him a former Book of his he had ſent me, and which I had written ſomething upon; it was a Book of <hi>Queries,</hi> and one part of the Title of it was <hi>Plain and Honeſt Dealing;</hi> When I had read the Book, (ſaith he) I found it to be ſo far from plain and honeſt, that I ſtruck out thoſe two words, and in their place wrought two others more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the matter and ſubſtance of the Book, <hi>viz. Falſe</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,</hi> I writ alſo ſomething on the Book, and ſomething on a Paper fixed to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having ſo done, ſent the Book back to him again, in all which I conceive I did him no wrong, and it was at my choice either to keep or give it away. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Pray obſerve what an ingenuous way he hath at <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Tooling</hi> it for to make a bad cauſe ſeem better, although in the beſt Sence both Treacherous and Fraudulent, and that in the greateſt and higheſt Degree, eſpecially as being in a caſe relating to Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and which if I were for the ſcaring with the threats of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:172122:37"/>puniſhment or Pillory, I ſcarce know a thing that deſerveth it more; but again, And it being at his choice as he ſays, to do with it what he would, you may ſee what he hath, and that is as by his own Confeſſion to blot out plain and honeſt dealing, (ſuch an Eye ſore, and offence unto him, that he neither loves, nor cares to ſee in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nor to practice in himſelf.) And then goeth on, and when I had read it, and found it to be ſo, ſaith he, I ſtruck out plain and and honeſt dealing, <hi>&amp;c. Anſwer,</hi> But if he had ſo found it, why not alſo ſo fair as to ſhew it unto others before he had done it, that they might alſo have known and ſeen his findings, and whither ſo or no, but to keep it ſo to himſelf, and what more or other then as in his to me, <hi>viz.</hi> Generals, ſuch generals that ſerve ſlanderers beſt to lurk under; but it is to be noted, that it was too nice and too cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical a point for him to venture upon, or any of the reſt of them, or elſe I ſhould no doubt have ſeen their Anſwer to them long before now, it being now near three years ſince. And there was another part relating alſo to the Title, which no doubt he reliſhed as ill as the other, and that was hidden things revealed and brought to light, but the evil doer ſuch as he, affects the ſhade of the Evening, and ſo is afraid of the approach of the day, but no doubt he concludes that his Reader is ſo tame and implicite in his faith, that he takes all for Truth and Goſpel. And yet for all this, conceives that he had done me no wrong, which muſt neceſſarily follow to riſe from one of theſe two Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> either that he thinks there is no Truce to be held or kept with thoſe he accounts for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> dark or bad Spirits, and me as ſuch, for ſo laying open, and diſcovering them, or that the cuſtom of Evil hath taken from him the Sence of it.</p>
            <p>And then again in <hi>Page</hi> 34. ſaith he, to make manifeſt the Folly as well as the Malice of this cavilling Man, he hath picked two paſſages out of theſe two <hi>Papers</hi> of mine, (meaning of thoſe he had ſo clandeſtinely affixed as before to my Book) neither of which ſaith he, was he willing to undertake to anſwer. To which I return, nor as little Reaſon that I ſhould, unleſs he would a come forth and appear in the open Day, (having ſomething elſe to do then to tend every ſleeveleſs impertinency of his or other,) the which if he had, he ſhould quickly have ſeen that I would have done more then only to a nibbled at it, as his phraſe is; yet as little as I made tryal of, I have made apparent to be of an evil and bitter taſte, as ſhall yet further ſhew when it falls in due order and courſe.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:172122:38"/>
            <p>And then goeth on, ſaying again, Wherein I cannot juſtly blame him, <hi>&amp;c. Anſwer,</hi> If ſo, and it be true, its the better, having ſo often and frequently without cauſe; but lets try how much he is mended; Again, (ſaid he) for his moſt diſhoneſtly reſting of them, to a ridiculous as well as to a wrong Sence, to fill two <hi>Pages,</hi> the 34. and 35th. of his with empty noiſes and clamours in a confuſed manner, and a nonſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical heap of Words, one of which he takes out of the latter part of my beforemention'd Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I Anſwer, that I took not out of it (for that it was the whole, and every part thereof tranſcribed <hi>verbatim,</hi> and as he ſent it me; and again, it was the firſt part and not the laſt, he affirms and avers it to be, and from thence do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that his Frenſical Zeal, or what ſhall I call it, hath thus cauſed him ſo to fall, yea, and that into three ſeveral Errors or Falſhoods all at once, (and by which it may be ſeen <hi>O. S.</hi> before, that he is not ſo wholly infallible, no not <hi>O. S.</hi> himſelf, which may deter him for the future thus proudly to inſult,) as Firſt, in aſſerting that I had taken it out of the latter part of his ſaid Paper, whenas it was the firſt. Secondly, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had taken it out of the aforeſaid Paper, when as before it was the Tranſcription of the whole of all and every part. Thirdly, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I filled two Pages with my noiſes, clamours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>y, &amp;c.</hi>) not ſo much as filled one, and if it be with empty Noiſes, Clamours, in a confuted manner and nonſenſical heap of words, its apparent that one <hi>Page</hi> thereof is his own, and therefore may thank himſelf for his own Raſhneſs and Folly, and if ſo empty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it appears ſo to be only in his own, ſince he hath not aſſign'd, no not ſo much as one particular in mine. But again, wherein doth it ſo appear that I have reſted his or either of their Words in the Caſe forecited, relating to the tying up of my Tongue, or in that of <hi>O. S.</hi>'s either, in his counting me for a Murtherer, or of his affrightning threats of corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Seeing I have ſaid no more, or otherwiſe of him and them then what was ſpoken by, and came from themſelves, for that they told of neither Miſtery nor Allegory, they intended, and if we may take them to mean what they ſay, or to ſay as they mean, how can we think or conclude otherways, or where ſhall we have them or rightly know what they intend or would be at. And that Bodily puniſhment and no Miſery was intended by <hi>O. S.</hi> In his threats is moſt apparent, as in <hi>Page</hi> 35. of his <hi>Reviler,</hi> where ſpeaking afreſh of it, he ſaith it is well he is ſo apprehenſiye of Bodily puniſhment, that the fears of that may deter him from ateempting that which might ſubject him to it, pray what more clear or can be plainer then this, though he quibbles ſo much about it, and as to that of the Tongue,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:172122:38"/>it hath been ſpoken to be before in my Anſwer to his Alligation, relating to the 4th. Article, as in <hi>Page</hi> 8. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> and where I have ſaid of the tying up of the Tongue, whither in a natural or ſpiritual Sence are both of them perſecution. And yet for all ſo confident and hardy is he in <hi>Page</hi> 35. as to ſay that all this Noiſe and Outcry I have made about Perſecution is for nothing, or without any Cauſe or ground given for it, and therefore how little to be regarded? Oh! <hi>O. S.</hi> hang down thy Head again as at <hi>W. L</hi>'s. and bluſh for ſhame, if not grown too impudent, as thy Language is to me. But what need I have ſpoken ſo much to this point or any otherways, then as the Caſe is ſo material and the Preſident ſo wicked and prepoſterious, relating to the tying up the Tongue, or at all, ſeeing that its plain and apparent, that <hi>O. S.</hi> is not only like minded with them, but hath far exceeded them in it, for they propos'd but for the tying up of one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Member, but he for puniſhment upon the whole Body, <hi>viz.</hi> not only upon the Tongue, but on the Head, Hands, Feet, yea, on all and every part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for as much as the word <hi>Body</hi> concludes and comprizes them all (eſpecially when ſo ſpoken in the general, without either limitation or reſtriction) and every member of it, of which it is made and compos'd, for that is an imperfect Body that hath not all and every one of its Members, as to the ſame import in the <hi>Cry,</hi> and if that be not Perſecution, I know not what is, and therefore he might (one would have thought) ſpared ſuch his flouting ſcoffs and jears in his Comment, on what he hath ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Page</hi> 49. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> (and the which he counteth for ſuch impertinent Nonſence, Whimſical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) where intending of me, he very gravely (ſaith he) if there be gravity in ſo great Folly, <hi>viz.</hi> that it might not I believe be amiſs, if but for the Truths ſake, that ſome antient and grave Friends would be and were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. (and I am of the ſame mind ſtill) as to examine and know of <hi>O. S.</hi> what manner or degree of puniſhment is to be, or muſt be, that my Body is to ſuffer and be puniſhed withal, and the which I am ready to think that none elſe, except <hi>O. S.</hi> and ſuch as he will account either in gravity or ſo great folly, and therefore may the ſafer conclude with him as in <hi>Page</hi> 36. of his <hi>Reviler,</hi> concerning his Husbandry in the Lord's Vineyard, of which ſaith he, I have nothing to boaſt of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the which is too true, as well as apparently prov'd, and this further let me add, that if his Heart were not as hard as the flinty Rock, and his Spirit as the Nether-Milſtone, he would have found cauſe to have both ſorrow'd and mourn'd for what he hath done; yea, and to have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:172122:39"/>rent his Heart inſtead of his Garment, and to have ſat him down in Aſhes, and hid his Face in the Dirt, if it were but for this one raſhneſs alone, as being the firſt Author, mover or propoſer for Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily puniſhment amongſt us, eſpecially in a caſe that relates wholly and alone to Religion and Conſcience, and however in this of mine, there being no other provocation to them, but only my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing againſt ſuch plain and apparent wickedneſs, Lording expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the other part relating to my Charge, as being a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,</hi> he would fain get out of it, under pretence that he only meant of my ſlaying of their Chriſtian Reputation: To which I do anſwer as before, he may ſay what he will, and mean what he pleaſes, for who can find out the depth of his and ſuch their politick and mental reſerves, that can thus riggle and ſcriggle to uſe his own Terms, and thus turn both any and every way, and if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of ſuch their horrid Pride, Lording, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be counted no leſs then Murther, or a ſlaying of their Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. I ſhall leave the Reader to judge of what and wherein it ſtands, and yet further to ſhew and make appear how little theſe Men do value or eſteem their Reputation. I ſhall give you in a Caſe or two more, and among the reſt, of one <hi>John Giding,</hi> and who was alſo one of my ſeven unjuſt Judges, who being at the Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Newbery,</hi> it being at the ſame time too that <hi>O. S.</hi> propos'd for an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was not then nor there aſhamed to affirm and aſſure to that they, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seven had been more hard and ſevere upon <hi>W. L.</hi> and <hi>J.B.</hi> then they had been upon me (and if ſo, why? and for what? ſeeing <hi>A. B.</hi> is ſuch a Criminal, and they ſo harmleſs and innocent) but ſuppoſe I ſhould grant it ſo, yet wherein doth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo appear, ſeeing they though thus found in ſuch their evil Actions and Converſation towards me, and to the Reproach of the holy Truth, has been and is nevertheleſs ſo appear'd for ſtill, and they to that it ſeems deſerved ſuch hardneſs and ſeverity to be ſhewed them, Juſtified and Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I ſay; And on the other hand to be thus and ſo Sentenced, Calumniated and Condemned; and is this a doing as you would be done unto, and as I obſerv'd in the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. ſurely there was cauſe for it, <hi>viz.</hi> for ſuch hard and ſevere Treatment towards them, and conſequently the greater cauſe too, where there's the greater Blame or Puniſhment to be inflicted, or elſe you have dealt as unjuſtly towards them, as it's apparent you have done by me. And therefore may I ſay of him, them, and the reſt, as <hi>O. S.</hi> doth of me and of <hi>D. H.</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Sion,</hi> in pag. 36. of his, <hi>viz.</hi> That if they were truely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Spiritual <hi>Sion:</hi> I doubt that is ſo long ago and they have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:172122:39"/>ſhewed ſo much unkindneſs to her ſince, that the acquaintance is worn out and loſt, whatever they may ſay or do, pretend to hide, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves and deceive others.</p>
            <p>The next is in the caſe of <hi>John Buy,</hi> upon whom ſome time ago I had a Bill of Ten Pound, and the which was to be paid upon ſight, but yet becauſe that I owed his Son ſeven Shillings and two Pence for wharfage of Goods, and ſome of them ſuch too, that was not uſual to be charged, nor never was to me, by any other wharfinger before; I ſay that barely, and alone upon the Score, and account of the aforeſaid ſeven and two Pence, and the which I never deny'd the payment of, either to him or his Son, and yet did he the aforeſaid <hi>J. B.</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, refuſe and put off paying me the ſaid Bill, though the time was and has been, as I ſignified to his Face, that I had given him more then ſeven times ſeven Shillings together, and that <hi>Gratis</hi> and free; and was alſo inſtrumental by endeavours with others to the making of it up to a competent Sum, when <hi>J. B.</hi> was lower I ſuppoſe both in Mind and Purſe. And if <hi>A. B.</hi> hath not ſo much of this world as he, yet I believe that he can be truſted with as much, and make as good and as honeſt payment to the full; and how is it reaſonable to be thought that they have, or do ſo much regard or eſteem of their Chriſtian Reputation that are thus ſo ſhort of, and far below Men of common Ingenuity, in that which relates to very Morals.</p>
            <p>And further, that I have hit it right in the explanation of <hi>D. H.</hi> ſo innocent ſimily, concerning the incurable wound that the aforeſaid hath given her, as pag. 36. and 37. is both clear and apparent, and too truly fulfilled upon her ſelf, poor honeſt Soul, for that it hath been the occaſion, as hinted, of the coſting her her Liſe, though <hi>O. S.</hi> as in pag. 37. of his, makes but a flouting, ſcoff, and a mere jear of it, his words as before being theſe, <hi>viz. The incurable Wound ſaith he they ſpoke of</hi> (<hi>viz. D. H.</hi> and my ſelf) is in their Heads and that it hath diſtemper'd both their Brains, and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture he cites out of <hi>John</hi> be not of right, more proper and applicable unto himſelf then to me, the which I ſhall forbear to inſert, leaſt it ſhould prove to his greater injury, though ſo bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd towards me in his ſo vile and wicked aſſertion in his ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. And in <hi>pag.</hi> 38. thus further, but <hi>A. B.</hi> is more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to be blam'd, ſaith <hi>O. S.</hi> in this Caſe, for before he publiſh'd thoſe falſe Charges againſt me, he knew that they had been heard three times over, and I each time declared innocent. And <hi>Hall</hi> was blam'd for his cauſeleſs clamours; to which I do anſwer, that I was ſo far from knowing that they were heard three times over, or that <hi>Hall</hi> was blam'd, that I knew not ſo much as that they were,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172122:40"/>or never heard, or at all, or that <hi>Hall</hi> was blamed by the aforeſaid; or indeed how ſhould I? (for had I been there, I ſhould not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have either heard or ſeen what was done or who blamed.) But if <hi>O. S.</hi> be no better at Accounts then in this, its a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtead of three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was heard ſo much as once, or indeed by any at all. For how (to uſe his own Phraſe) this his confuſed nonſenſical Noiſe and heap of words can in any Sence be true or hold together, for my part I cannot tell; where he ſays, <hi>viz.</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had publiſhed choſe falſe Charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I knew they had been heard three times, and then proceeding to the proof of it, ſaith he, firſt at a Monthly meeting, and afterwards at a Quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and what doth a Monthly and a Quarterly-meeting make three? yet obſerve, any thing will ſerve with one that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cares nor fears what he ſaith, and therefore ſhall return upon himſelf in his own ſtyle, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 4. of his <hi>Reviler, viz.</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtumbles, falls and foils himſelf moſt ſhamefully, as alſo in the foregoing, where he alſo falls into three untruths and apparent errors all at once, but if it ſhould be alledged that he meant a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three times a piece at each meeting, <hi>viz.</hi> Monthly and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which inſtead of mending would marr it the more, and inſtead of his pretended three, would make it apparent ſix, though in <hi>pag.</hi> 38. he makes his three but two again.</p>
            <p>And in the next, as if I had incourag'd <hi>Hall</hi> in his clamours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, his proof for it, cited out of <hi>pag.</hi> 36. of the <hi>Cry:</hi> And becauſe I there ſaid that I had received near a dozen Letters from <hi>Hall, &amp;c.</hi> but he doth not tell, ſaith he, how many I had ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. To the firſt, if I had incourag'd <hi>Hall</hi> in his clamours, how came it to paſs that I moved for a hearing (as own'd and acknowledg'd,) and to what end, but to underſtand whether cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or truths?</p>
            <p>And as to the other, about the ſaid Letters (to the beſt of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) I rather adviſed him to forbear them, for that I thought I knew as much of <hi>O. S.</hi> as he could tell me; and the which may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſerve in anſwer to his Compariſon of the foul humours in the Body gathering together, ſince I took the beſt method according to Truth in order to diſperſe them. And which alſo may ſhew <hi>O. S</hi>'s miſtake in ſuppoſing I had occaſion to fiſh out of them as he chargeth in <hi>pag.</hi> 36. of his <hi>Reviler.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:172122:40"/>
            <p>And in <hi>pag.</hi> 33. he ſeems to have done having given an Anſwer as would have it thought to all thoſe Charges and Alligations of mine in particular againſt or relating unto <hi>W. L. J. B. &amp;c.</hi> though I have skipt over ſeveral both weighty and material ones; (but more of that hereafter Proceedings;) I now come, ſaith he, to that part of his Book which is level'd more directly and particularly at me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at <hi>pag.</hi> 33. of the <hi>Cry;</hi> where he ſaith, ſeeing that <hi>O. S.</hi> one of the ſeven unjuſt Judges hath taken a freſh occaſion thus to run out againſt me, through ſome offence he hath taken at my late Book of Queries; it hath come into my thoughts further to diſcover and manifeſt him, and that in his plain and naked ſhape, not only from the evidence and proof from his own Mouth and Pen; but alſo from the Allegation, reports and accounts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerning him, and in <hi>pag.</hi> 35. doth hint again at the cauſe or occaſion thereof, and that was for my altering with my Pen, ſaith he, the Title of his former Book from plain and honeſt Dealing, to falſe and treacherous, <hi>&amp;c. Anſw.</hi> To the firſt: of manifeſting him in his plain and naked Shape, as I thought ſo to have done, and have been as good as my Word; and alſo do believe that nakeder was he never ſtrip'd, nor his nakedneſs made appear; for why ſhould his Sheeps Cloathing be a means to deceive or beguile the ſimple?</p>
            <p>And as to the other part: of proving him to be as charg'd, and that from the Evidence of his Mouth and Pen. I think there's no occaſion to add further proof to the manifeſting the Truth of it, then what is ſpoken, written, contain'd and publiſh'd of him in this and my other two Books. The firſt forecited by him, <hi>viz. Hidden things reveal'd and brought to Light, or plain and honeſt Dealing with</hi> W. L. <hi>and</hi> J. B. the other, <hi>The Cry of the Oppreſſed in</hi> Sion; and if I have been too remiſs or ſhort therein, I intend to mend it in the next.</p>
            <p>And as to the other part of it taken from the Allegations, Reports and Accounts of others; I have given him both my Authors and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and neither of which hath he refuted, (that I obſerv'd) or proved for a falſhood or lye. And as I told him before in an other caſe of the Scripture he Cites out of mine of the <hi>Cry,</hi> viz. <hi>Report, and we will report;</hi> It chiefly relates to ſuch, and the like groundleſs Lyes and Falſhoods too much in uſe with him and other of his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates. And a Word further, that if it ſhould be thought that I have not been ſo large as is Judg'd or thought proper and needful concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Alligation s of <hi>N.H.</hi> &amp;c. I do give the Reader thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to underſtand, that <hi>N. H.</hi> doth follow the ſaid <hi>O. S.</hi> and that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172122:41"/>from Meeting to Meeting, up and down thoſe parts of the County, in order to make good his ſaid Charge, and to prove it to his Face; and beſides, I do underſtand by a Letter I have ſeen of his, dated no longer ago than the 12th. of the 7th. Month, 1697. that he hath new and freſh Matters to alledge in charge againſt him and another; alſo of a latter date, and ſome of them, for his wilfull and downright Lyes he hath put in Print, meaning in his, <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore what ever he hath further to ſay, of or concerning the aforeſaid, unleſs it be in thoſe Matters or Things that more immediately relate unto my ſelf, I think neither to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or take any further notice of them; But to refer both the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (and himſelf) for their proof and truth, that, as ſaid, attends it, and would be glad of the opportunity to do it. And again, ſaith he, in pag. 37. ſpeaking of me, He <hi>beginneth his inquiry in a high and lofty Stile,</hi> viz. <hi>Firſt, I ſhall demand of him to Anſwer for himſelf in the caſe of</hi> D. <hi>and</hi> N. H. <hi>in the</hi> Vale of White Horſe, <hi>&amp;c. and how well this becometh him,</hi> ſaith he, (meaning by my being ſo bold, <hi>&amp;c.) Anſw.</hi> And had I not cauſe to begin my inquiery, as I did in the caſe and caſes alledged? I having, as ſaid, received near a dozen Letter from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, as in pag. 37. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> and all of them cheifly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally relating to <hi>O. S.</hi> Falſneſs, Unjuſtice and Treacherous Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the aforeſaid, as he cited for Oppreſſion, with crys for Juſtice, is the Tenor of the whole, and as reported, the ſame infect throughout the whole County. (But at <hi>Farington</hi> more eſpecially, the place of his former aboad, where I have ſeen with my own Eyes and heard with my own Ears, the mournful Complaints of ſome towards whom, through ſuch his moroſs Carriage and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he had given ſo great an offence, as that they had left both the Societies and Aſſemblies of Friends; and which cauſed ſome of <hi>Abington,</hi> no doubt, to precaution of the like towards them, when he came to inhabit there, as hinted in the <hi>Cry.</hi> But how lofty and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious himſelf, when I have told all, I ſhall leave the Reader to judge, ſeeing that in the firſt place (as by his own Confeſſion) he thus Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphized and abuſed my Book, by ſcratching out of my Title to it, <hi>Plain and Honeſt Dealing,</hi> and putting in of his own <hi>Falſe and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Plain and Honeſt,</hi> as in pag. 37. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> the which I account as both Fraudulent, and Imperious, and no doubt, puniſhable by the Law; and though he hath ſo frequently charged me with Malice, Envy, Quarrelſom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet who can at all, or in the leaſt account or think otherways of this, I ſay to thus marr, metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize, and confuſe my Title or Book, and then to ſend or return it back again unto me, that I might ſee what he had done; and not at
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172122:41"/>all better in them that firſt tore one of my ſaid Books into pieces at <hi>John Buys,</hi> and after committed it to the Flames, as cited in the <hi>Cry;</hi> and in which <hi>O.S.</hi> is likewiſe mute and ſilent; nor it in the fore-named, or thoſe others that adviſed the Friends of <hi>Windſor</hi> for to follow their evil Example, which all comes from one and the ſelf-ſame ground and cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Perſecution;</hi> and is no other than the Seed and Ground of it, notwithſtanding in p. 35. he ſeems to ſo wipe his Mouth, and ſay of it, <hi>viz. That there is nothing that we are more againſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Perſecution.</hi> To which I do Anſwer, That it may happily be ſo in Words, Say-So's; but his Practice above all others hath too apparently ſhewed and proved it by his Deeds. And in the ſecond, by his ſo wickedly and viſely charging, ſentencing, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning me for a <hi>Murderer,</hi> and to add Authority to his ſaid Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to make as if the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had done it, or accounted me as ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the next place, in his ſo threatning or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with his Corporal or Bodily puniſhment, and by which the Reader may obſerve how one wicked Deed or Action makes way for and uſhers in another; I ſay as firſt ſo Enviouſly to alter the true and proper <hi>Title</hi> of my Book, which both he and they were afraid to medle with and aſhamed to Anſwer; neither is it Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Day, though the matter contained therein was only <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> And in the next ſo to Judge, Sentence me as before. And in the third, to ſo endeavour to affrighten me with the puniſhing of my Body, and yet for all this, to ſo Inſinuate as before, <hi>viz.</hi> which there is nothing that we are more againſt; but I pray what after the Burning of Hereticks Books, or ſuch they account as ſuch, but in the next place to take hold of the Body, where power, and is grown to that degree of Cruelty as to do it (as are many and frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the caſe) and what more Hardy or Cruel then for him, or others to ſo account his or their Brother for a <hi>Murderer,</hi> a <hi>Devil,</hi> a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Wolf,</hi> a <hi>Swine;</hi> yea, and no leſs than one too for <hi>whom is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever,</hi> &amp;c. And are not theſe the Seeds, yea, and the grown Seeds too of it, <hi>viz. Perſecution;</hi> and which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appears at firſt but as a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, the leaſt of all Seeds, but at length into a Root and a Blade, and then into a tall and flouriſhing Tree.</p>
            <p>I ſay theſe, with the aforeſaid account out of the <hi>Vale,</hi> of the ſame or like nature towards them, that I had met with from him, towards my ſelf, made me take the Boldneſs, or the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, as he elſewhere calls it, for to thus demand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:172122:42"/>of him, as I think well I might, and had cauſe enough for it; and to underſtand of his Converſation as well as of his Power, that had ſo taken and aſſumed unto himſelf, ſuch an unaccountable Authority and Prerogative, yea and more then barely this too, as in pag. 36. of the <hi>Cry;</hi> and the which I have alſo alledged, as part of the Reaſon of my ſo demanding and enquiring; and that was for his ſo thundring forth, and that like ſo many Curſes, the Wrath and Vengenance of God againſt me; the which, with a great deal more of the like nature and tendency, <hi>O. S.</hi> ſlips over and hides in Silence; being either afraid or aſhamed, or both, to either recite or tranſcribe.</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>To back the Buſineſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>O. S.</hi> meaning of me) for my only endeavouring for a hearing, in order for Juſtice to be done the poor man <hi>N. H.</hi> in his caſe) <hi>he infers, how that I had ſent a Letter to the Counſellor,</hi> viz. <hi>Counſellor</hi> Mallet <hi>at the ſame time, and by the ſame Bearer,</hi> &amp;c. And what's my offence I pray in it, if ſo? <hi>And of which having obtained a Copy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I inſerted it here, that the Reader may ſee how much this envious Man buſieth himſelf in that which did not concern him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto which I do return, that if Equity and the craving of, crying or ſtandidg for Juſtice, makes me appear to be ſo envious, then let it be ſo; or on the other hand, that if it be nor is to be none of <hi>O. S</hi>'s concern, yet I do look upon and think it to be mine; and that under a double Conſideration in this preſent caſe, and not only mine in what is or ought to be the common concern, I mean as with reſpect to Juſtice towards all, but the like of all other true hearted and ſincere Chriſtians with me. And what have I moved for, or endeavoured to be done by the Counſellor in the caſe of the aforeſaid, or on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, farther or other than barely it, I ſhall leave the Impartial to judge; (my Words in the aforeſaid) to him being theſe, I therefore intreat thee to do the poor Man juſtice. Obſerve, <hi>Intreat,</hi> for that it's to be feared, that it hath been hard for him to obtain it hitherto. Obſerve again, that it appears it ſeems as Envy and Envious in <hi>O. S</hi>'s thoughts, though if it be but ſo much as to either deſire, cry, intreat, or requeſt for Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either in my own or anothers caſe.</p>
            <p>And then again in p. 39. ſo wickedly to inſinuate, (and to place an Obſervation upon it too) as if I had reflected upon the Monthly and Quarterly Meeting; whenas I have told him before that I did not hear that the matter had been brought before, or heard by any, or either of them; and if I have written at any time what may ſeem to import it, I do declare that it was not ſo much as in my thoughts, or ever intended by me, of any or other than of himſelf, and the reſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172122:42"/>of them that ſo claim'd, and that taken upon themſelves to be it or them, by their ſo ſwaying, ruling and over-ruling, as they liſt or pleaſe, and then to cry out and make a noiſe as if the agreement, order, and act of the Meeting, and the which I have rightly ſtiled but a Ruling Party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Letter ſent me by Counſellor <hi>Mallot</hi> (my eſteemed Friend) as in p. 40. of his, <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. in or with relation to the Paper or Writing of <hi>O. S</hi>'s, that the aforeſaid had but tranſcribed for his better Vindication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the which no doubt, but the Counſellor intended well, in and for that end, though in <hi>O. S.</hi> a meer piece of Craft, the which nevertheleſs <hi>O. S.</hi> has inſerted, and that no doubt too but as anundeniable proof of its truth, though in it ſelf, as may be ſeen, and that, as we uſe to ſay, with half an Eye; that it was no more or other, <hi>viz.</hi> then the Counſellor's building upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>O. S</hi>'s laying; for that the ſaid Paper, or the Counſellor's ſtate of the caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was no other then <hi>O. S</hi>'s own Paper, or of his own drawing, that the aforeſaid had tranſcribed, or written his Paper by; and can any Man reaſonably think that <hi>O. S.</hi> of all men, will either ſtate or write the moſt or worſt of things, that are againſt himſelf or his own Vindication, that ſo can and do take the privilege and liberty to uſe ſuch Crafts and Sophiſtry to excuſe and clear himſelf and others, he undertakes for, in things that are ſo apparently notoriouſly bad, evil and unjuſt, all which may therefore ſerve for no other or further uſe, then only to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſaid Crafts, and to bring his ſecret and hidden works to the Light, and diſcovery of the Day.</p>
            <p>And again, in pag. 41. <hi>But ſo far hath his Envy carried him,</hi> ſaith he, intending of me, <hi>that he ſticks not to pervert the Judgment given by the Counſellor;</hi> For thus ſaith he of him, pag. 38. <hi>And as to Counſellor</hi> Mallet, <hi>though he ſay that thou haſt dealt fairly by them, as in reſpect to Law, but did not, nor could not as in reſpect to tenderneſs and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it being in the caſe of</hi> N. H. <hi>And now the Reader</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may obſerve that theſe terms,</hi> viz. <hi>in reſpect to Law, to Tenderneſs, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, are not Counſellor</hi> Mallot's <hi>words, but words thruſt in by</hi> A. B. <hi>Counſellor</hi> Mallot <hi>in the judgment that he gave, did not ſay that I had dealt fairly with them, as in reſpect to Law, though</hi> A. B. <hi>hath the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to charge him with ſaying ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed it is ſtrange Language, and which the like I do not remember that ever I met withal from any, unleſs <hi>John Reaſons</hi> and <hi>William Spikeman,</hi> Men of the ſame ſort and moroſe temper, who to Impudence have added Brazen-face too, and yet for all this, <hi>O. S.</hi> can write a Book, and Title it, <hi>A Reviler Rebuked,</hi> and ſcoffingly tells me of <hi>Billingſgate Rhetorick,</hi> &amp;c. But</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:172122:43"/>
            <p>Again, neither did <hi>A. B.</hi> ſay that the Counſellor had ſaid ſo in the Judgment that he had given, as moſt apparent, though ſo rated and abus'd for nothing; for my Words were only theſe, as in pag. 38. cited by him, <hi>viz.</hi> And as to Counſellor <hi>Mallot,</hi> though ſays that thee haſt dealt fairly by them, as in reſpect to Law, but did not nor could not as in reſpect to Tenderneſs and Chriſtianity, wherein I only mentioned what the Counſellor had ſaid, and not ſo much as in one Jot or Title of either Judgment, or of his giving of it. And therefore to the end that the Reader may the better be inform'd in the matter, I ſhall add this true and further account of it, and whereby <hi>O. S.</hi> may ſee his own Incivility and abuſive Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be aſham'd for it too, if he would be perſwaded to it, or had any ſhame in him.</p>
            <p>I being one day at the Counſellors Houſe, and if I miſtake not, lodged there the ſame Night, and we happening to be ſpeaking of the Difference between the foremention'd; the Counſellor took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from thence both to ſhow and read unto me what he had drawn up as his Senſe and Judgment in the caſe, though I ſhould have ſaid <hi>O. S</hi>'s. Whereupon I did make him this Anſwer, <hi>viz. O.S.</hi> That altho' I could not ſay, but that the aforeſaid, viz. <hi>O. S.</hi> had dealt fairly by them, with reſpect to Law, yet propos'd this as a further Queſtion, whether he might not have been more kindly dealt by and treated, as with reſpect to Chriſtianity, and Tenderneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Circumſtances they both were under? unto which the Counſellor did both conſent and agree with me, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might have been more tender in that reſpect; and which I do believe the Counſellor doth ſtill remember, (And this is all, and the whole of the matter that <hi>O.S.</hi> has thus ſhamefully harraſed and abuſed me about.</p>
            <p>And again, in p. 42. he inſinuates another Charge againſt me, ſaith he, by way of Queſtion, <hi>viz. And was it not plainly proved againſt thee at Meeting held at</hi> W. Lambel<hi>'s, the 26th of the 10th Month,</hi> 1694. <hi>and that before ſeveral of thy own Friends, and others alſo that thou haſt been both remiſs in, and Falſe and Treacherous alſo in thy Truſt, in the caſe of</hi> Richard Daniel, <hi>late of</hi> Redding, <hi>in which Thee waſt concerned as an Executor with</hi> L. K. <hi>to the Will of the aforeſaid</hi> Daniel. And unto which <hi>O. S.</hi> anſwers <hi>No;</hi> and his Reaſon for it, in only believing that not one of his own Friends had any ſuch thoughts in the leaſt, but were ſatisfied that he had acted uprightly both as a Man and a Chriſtian in that affair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereupon thinks he had ſaid and done enough, and that he needed ſay nor do no more in it.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:172122:43"/>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the firſt; And if do ſo inſinuate a Charge by way of Queſtion, yet ſuch it ſeems as he will not ſo much as touch upon directly, or in the leaſt undertake to Anſwer, though his Credit and Repute depends ſo much upon it. And pray obſerve how another, <hi>(viz.</hi> a Charge) when has confeſt both in the ſame page and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, That it had been a Charge againſt him no leſs than fourteen Years ago, and how an Inſinuation, ſeeing as before he hath both acknowledged to and confeſt unto it; I mean to be a Charge againſt him. And if <hi>O.S</hi>'s Firends that he thinks will ſay ſo, I am ſure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Juſtice nor Truth if they did. But if ſo, where is his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? ſeeing that they are mute, and have ſaid and teſtified nothing for or on his behalf in the caſe: or will this paſs for an Anſwer to it, and ſufficient for to clear him of the Crime, and that from one to that in pag. 25. of his, <hi>A Reviler,</hi> ſo Brandeth <hi>A. B.</hi> for his placing his Obſervations both in general and in particular without ſolid matter, fair Reaſoning, Proof, or Demonſtration, that has alledged none of them all in this of his; I ſay neither in Argument or Evidence, but a meerly juſtifying of himſelf, as his Words are of me in the page forecited, I ſay by his meerly believing ſo, and concluding that his Friend did the like of him.</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>If ſo as have ſaid, and it be true, why doth he not produce the Record of the Minute made by the aforeſaid upon it? But it's to be noted, that he dares not ſo much as to look, touch, or to meddle there,</hi> viz. <hi>at</hi> Newberry, <hi>that had been ſo falſe and treacherous to them as before.</hi> And again, as to that of the Meeting at <hi>Newberry</hi> about fourteen Years ago, he hath cited, in order to his further clearing and vindication; and the which he alſo endeavours to inſinuate, as if a wilful forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs on my part: To the which do return, that as to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, I remember no more or further of it, than only that there was ſuch a Meeting at the aforeſaid place, and about the ſame time; but as to the Meeting's buſineſs, or the occaſion thereof, I had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether forgot, but that as meer accidently upon ſearch, I found by a Letter that was ſent me along time ago, by one of the Friends that was at it, and which gave this following Account, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Meeting was wholly, only and alone as on purpoſe for <hi>Tho. Curtis,</hi> to make good and prove a Charge that he had alledged and in charge againſt the aforeſaid; and the ſaid Charge was, that the ſaid <hi>T.C.</hi> would undertake to prove <hi>O. Samſom</hi> to be a corrupt Man, and the which hath ſomewhat revived it afreſh in my Memory, and by which it may be ſeen that <hi>O.S.</hi> has been formerly charged very hard and high too by others; yea, and that no leſs than fourteen Years ago, far before that I either medled or was concerned with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:172122:44"/>him, in relation to any of theſe things; and this of the aforeſaid caſe of <hi>Daniel's,</hi> (if I miſtake not) was alledged, to make good and affix the truth of this Charge upon him. As likewiſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that any thing muſt and is to do for Evidence with him in his caſe, if but ſo long, and long enough as to be forgotten by the Perſon or Perſons that is engaged with him, though a matter of a quite contrary nature and quality; and how that one thing muſt give Evidence and make Proof to another, when expoſed to ſuch a ſtrait, as often he is, that he knows not what to either alledge, offer, or ſay for himſelf.</p>
            <p>And then again out of p. 41. <hi>He taxeth me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a baſe and unworthy deceitful Trick, about the things that he was to buy for the Friends that were Priſoners in</hi> Newgate, <hi>and which for the better accommodating of them, he deſired my aſſiſtance in it, yet nevertheleſs I, (he ſays) for my own Ends and Intreſt, acted quite contrary to the ſaid Ends propoſed by him, as well as to the Friends diſadvantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And the Lord knows that I was conſcious in it on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and the deceit of it lay on <hi>O.S</hi>'s part, in pretending that he would do as I had deſired and directed him, and that was to buy the things for the aforeſaid, where moſt probably he might have had the beſt Choice, the beſt Goods, and the beſt Penny-worth: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, and that upon ſo poor, low, and ſo baſe an account, as may be ſuppoſed as the only taging of a few Laces for one, he went and bought them of another, a very poor and ſorry Man, and one of them too that he counts for Seperates, and who in a little time after Broke both in mine and ſeveral others Debts, and that not all in the caſe, but his ſo confidently denying afterwards, that I had ſo ordered and directed him, and as was alſo charged with the ſame by <hi>T. C.</hi> and that before the Monthly Meeting, as in the page forecited, and where ſo greatly offended with me, becauſe that I could not Diſſemble, Lye, and play the Hypocrite like himſelf, and at laſt ſo wicked and baſe as to ſolve it over again with this cunning Prank of Subtilty, <hi>viz.</hi> To commit and leave it to the Lord as Judge betwixt us, being afraid of its further Examining, as well he might, and aſhamed too leſt I ſhould have laid him open, naked, and a diſcovered him to them all, for I ever hated ſuch a way of a falſe diſguiſe in any; and therefore whether or not to his own Ends, as well as to the Friends injury, ſhall leave to the Impartial to judge, as alſo whether, as his Words are in the Concluſion upon that ſubject, that the Lord will ever rebuke me for my ſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying againſt ſuch hidden and myſterious Subtilties and ways of Craft and Deceit, as he calls upon him for.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:172122:44"/>
            <p>And again, <hi>He hath ſhot another of his Bolts at me, as in pag.</hi> 42. (ſaith he) <hi>about my Brother's Widow, which he brings in thus: And again, as to his Treachery, Heard-heartedneſs, &amp;c. what need I a troubled my ſelf to have fetched ſuch a Circuit round to prove</hi> O. S. <hi>Treacherous, Hard-hearted, and without Natural Affection to others, when ſeen, found and known to be ſo at home as I may ſay, even to his own Relations, as witneſs his hardy, ſowr, and moroſe carriage towards his Brother's Wife; and for proof thereof, alledgeth that my carriage towards her was ſowr, hardy, and moroſe; And now if this were as true as its falſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it doth hardy, ſowr and moroſe prove a Man to be Treacherous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, for that the word <hi>Treachery</hi> in a Perſon, (as by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dictionary) ſignifies and imports to be one that is Perfidious, or Diſloyal: And is it not both Perfidiouſneſs and Diſloyalty in <hi>O.S.</hi> and eſpecially as being a Relation, who inſtead of viſiting of the Fatherleſs and Widow in their Diſtreſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Widow when ſhe had loſt her Husband, and the Children when ſo near a Parent, the which the Apoſtle alſo counteth both for the pure Religion and undefiled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what the end I pray to be given them at ſuch a time? Is it, I ſay, to further oppreſs, grieve, and to add Sorrow to Sorrow to the already afflicted; or not rather, or on the contrary Hand, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be a Help, Support and Comfort unto them? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>O.S.</hi> hath been ſo towards her, the effects doth too evidently ſhew and make appear to the contrary, who inſtead of making the Widow's heart to rejoyce, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 42. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> He hath cauſed her's to ake, to ſorrow, and to mourn, and ſome of her tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations with her; ſome of which my Eyes have ſeen, and my Ears have heard; and when troubled at it, and asked the Cauſe, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that has been made me, was, <hi>O. S. has been here,</hi> &amp;c. The which if not both Perfidious and Diſloyal, for my part I know not what it is. And if this not it, what ſhall we ſay of his thus ſo perfidiouſly and evilly ſurmiſing of her, <hi>viz.</hi> as if unleſs he had an Eye of Care and Watchfulneſs over her in the caſe of the Legacies he is, as he ſays, in truſt for, for the Children, that there was a doubtfulneſs or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their being deprived or wronged of them.</p>
            <p>In his ſo jealouſly ſuſpecting her, as before, of Treachery, that was ſo honeſt, upright and true, ſhall therefore only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader for his better ſatisfaction concerning her and the truth of it, <hi>viz</hi> her Fidelity, to the account of an Antient Friend of thoſe parts, ſent me in a Letter in the Year 1696. (though I could ſay a great deal as to my own ſenſe and knowledge of her, as an honeſt and ſincere Woman) which is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> I have not ſeen (ſaith the aforeſaid) <hi>Oliver Samſon</hi>'s Book, but hear that as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:172122:45"/>to the paſſage about <hi>John Samſom</hi>'s Widow, he ſays that what he had done, was to have Juſtice done to the Children; which implies as if ſhe had not done juſtly by them, which is ſuch a baſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, that it is well known that her Motherly care, tenderneſs, and affection was ſuch, that ſhe exceeded moſt own Mothers; and this is ſo well known not only to her own Relations, but Friends, Neighbours and Acquaintance can teſtifie the ſame. I could ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his, <hi>viz. O.S</hi>'s corrupt and falſe dealing about our former Concerns here at <hi>Newberry,</hi> which would be a great Blow to him; but for ſeveral Cauſes and Reaſons I am willing at preſent to forbear.</p>
            <p>And then proceeding, ſaith, <hi>I have now gone through his Book, ſo as to Anſwer whatſoever ſeems to have any appearance of weight in it; and I hope to the Reader's ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if ſo, it muſt be ſuppoſed to be only him and ſuch that hath not had the oppertunity, or cares not, or regards not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it.</p>
            <p>And further ſaith he, <hi>As to his confuſed Clamours with which his Book abounds, eſpecially the latter part of it, vented in a ſtile of</hi> Billings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>Rhetorick, I do not think it worth my while to trouble my ſelf, or my Reader any further about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although ſo far beyond it in himſelf, and that throughout his whole Work, or either the Order or Rules of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: And yet would fain thus wipe his Mouth at laſt, as if ſo modeſt and demure, that there's neither ground nor reaſon to be jealous of or ſuſpect him as guilty of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>But again ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall ſubjoin a Teſtimony from the Friends of the Monthly-Meeting of</hi> Farrington, <hi>and their-away, which might of it ſelf, I ſuppoſe, have been ſufficient to have cleared my Reputation in the judgment of the impartial, from the Muck and Dirt he has endeavoured to caſt upon it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then come to a Concluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But whatever he concludes or believes of the matter, yet I am nevertheleſs of the mind, that when examin'd, that inſtead of being ſufficient or to the clearing of his Reputation, and cleanſing from the Dirt already caſt upon him, that it will rather create more ſcruples, beſtain in the firſt, and give a greater cauſe of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſting of his deſerved Dirt upon him in the laſt.</p>
            <p>And now as to his <hi>Farrington</hi> or <hi>Charlow</hi> Certificate, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 45. That he has thus gotten and procured, and doubts not but it will do his Buſineſs, and be ſufficient to clear his Reputation, and cleanſe him from his Dirt too in the judgment of the Impartial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pray Note, that it's no more nor no other than a meer and plain piece of Craft, and a no Sociation Pardonerſhip or Faction belonging to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> held, kept up and maintained amongſt them, and that meerly or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:172122:45"/>only as if on purpoſe to ſerve and anſwer their Ends and Intreſt as often as ſhall have need and occaſion for it. Or is it to be ſo much as ſuppoſed, or in the leaſt queſtion'd or ſuſpected, but that <hi>O. S.</hi> hath both Power and Intereſt, and that ſufficient and enough to procure as many of them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch Certificates as their are Months in the Year, if need be or occaſion for them; and yet for all that, for them to ſo go for or under the Name, Guiſe and Notion of a Monthly Meeting; I ſay, tho' ſo Sign'd but with four, yea, and all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them to his Kindred and Relations: and further than this, that if the Queſtion might be but truly anſwered, I have cauſe to believe that the aforeſaid Certificate was written to by no other than himſelf, as was the foregoing that Counſellor <hi>Mallot</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in order for his better Vindication, as in p. 40. O the depth of ſuch hidden and groſs Hypocriſie and Deceit, what ſhall I ſay, Muck, Mire, and Dirt; which was there ever the like committed by any? a thing to be both abhorr'd and condemn'd in all the Courts that bare but ſo much as the Name of Judicature, when as inſtead of twelve of a Man's equals, which the Law of the Land allows to be thus only Try'd by four of the Kindred and near Relations of the Perſon accuſed. And are not near Relations prohibited by the Laws; ſo juſt are they therein as not to be allowed as Evidence or Witneſs thus one for another. Again, and was there not as many, his Relations excepted, or more that appeared for me, and denyed the Signing of vour ſaid Paper of Aſſociation, than appeared for it. And did not <hi>Francis Clark</hi> of <hi>Childred</hi> in particular, and who was one of their near Neighbours too, that both denyed and refuſed to Sign it, and the reaſon that he gave for it, for that he had not heard of any one that could charge or alledge any thing juſtly againſt me, as with reſpect to my Life, Converſation, or otherways; but that I walked according unto or as become the Profeſſion of Truth; or words to this effect, though he did not ſo of <hi>O. S.</hi> But no more as to that at preſent; and were you not angry and much offended with him for it?</p>
            <p>And further obſerve how implicit and dark both in their Senſe, as well as Certificate (through their ſaid Intereſt, Partnerſhip, Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as to ſo and thus ignorantly infer and conclude, <hi>viz.</hi> that what I had done, as before, in order to the diſcovery of ſuch their Wickedneſs and Deceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tended to the diſhonour of the Name of the Lord, and the defaming of Antient Friends; implying thereby no leſs then as if both the Name of the Lord, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Antient Friends ſtood in the connivance at hiding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of ſuch Corrupt Groſs and Notorious Evil, whereas in real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:172122:46"/>and truth, both the Honour of God and the repute of true and upright hearted Friends, both Antient and others then ſtood, I mean Antiently and every ſence in the judging and keeping down and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, every the leaſt appearance of any ſuch evil and corrupt Tree; for that (I ſay) as before Judgment ever was, and ſtill is, and ought and ſhould be kept and continued upon the Head of it; yea, and that both Root and Branch; for ſo it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>And further ſay they, <hi>Particularly our dear Friend</hi> O. S. <hi>in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Book</hi> (viz. mine of the <hi>Cry) in two remarkable matters,</hi> viz. <hi>in the caſe of</hi> Nicholas Hall <hi>and the Widow</hi> Bounce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I pray wherein? for have I done more or any other in them, or either of them, than to ask a Query, or demand of <hi>O. S.</hi> in the aforeſaid Caſe, and the reaſon of ſuch my boldneſs too, was upon the ſcore and account of his ſo wickedly perverting the Scriptures, in counting or judging me for a <hi>Murderer,</hi> with his threats of Corporeal Puniſhment, and the pronouncing of ſuch his dreadful Threats and Curſes againſt me, as more at large in p. 36. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And to the end, the Reader may yet further ſee what a ſort of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate ſigners he hath gotten, and they be, and how in Affinity in Spirit as well as in Blood, pray obſerve how they further tell you, and that upon their concluſion of the aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that I being falſe (as they ſay) in the matter relating to <hi>N. H.</hi> and the Widow <hi>Bounce,</hi> that they were alſo ſatisfied, that all my other Alligations againſt the aforeſaid, were alſo falſe, the which I hope the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will take good notice of; and how unfit <hi>O. S.</hi> as before, or any of his ſaid Certificating Relations are, for either juſt Judge, Judges or Judgment, that do thus raſhly conclude (if ſhould grant it for Truth) that becauſe I have wronged them in the aforeſaid, that therefore have done the like in all the whole, and every part of the reſt of my Charges and Alligations, of which I can ſay no leſs then that it's like <hi>O. S.</hi> and their Line of Truth and Ballance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they uſed to meaſure and weigh by, and yet for all to thus inſinuate, as if concern'd for the Honour of God, and the holy Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore pray let them ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much like Men, as to ask their Neighbour the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, if ſuch corrupt unjuſt, dirty Stuff and Traſh would not be even hiſſed out of the Courts and Judicatures of all Men; yea, and that with both Notorious abhorance and ſcorn, and which were indeed ineffect for to ſay, that becauſe a man is found Guilty (if as before ſhould grant the caſe, which in no way can in mine, they having firſt created one Falſhood, and then made uſe of it as a Foundation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:172122:46"/>for another) of the Stealing of a Cock, a Hen, or ſome ſmall or trivial thing, yet he ſtanding indicted for Burglary and Murders as as well as ſuch petty Felony, and the firſt only being proved againſt him, (I ſay) though no more or other then in the caſe forecited, yet that, and for all that he is to be, muſt be, and ſhall be fourd as Guilty of them all by the Jury, and Sentenced and Condemned too by the Judge; the method and way indeed of <hi>O. S.</hi> and his four Aſſociate-Relations, Oyer and Terminer, and all the Juſtice that is to be expected from them or any ſuch.</p>
            <p>And a Word further, as to that in the caſe of the Counſellor's tranſcribing of the aforementioned Paper of <hi>O. S's.</hi> as in pag. 40. as the true and right ſtate of the caſe; and for his better Vindication, I ſhall propoſe this only as a Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Is it ever ſeen, known, or at all uſual, or ever practiſed in the method and cuſtom of our Law, for to admit or allow the Accuſed or Criminal, to draw up or give in to either Judge or Jury, the Matter of Fact, as in charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and for which he ſtands indicted or accuſed; and what he ſo draweth up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be accounted or allowed for truth, or authentick; and if ſo, there will ſoon, I do think, be no occaſion for either Judge or Jury, Oyer or Terminer, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, or accuſed, is to be them both, <hi>viz.</hi> Accuſer and Judge; and therefore <hi>O. S.</hi> in the aforeſaid being no other or better then this in his caſe, I ſhall leave it to the Impartial to judge, whether what the Counſellor hath done in order for his better Vindication, hath not been much for the worſt, and tends only to the further diſcovery of the aforeſaid in his caſe, far more than if the Counſellor had let it wholly end altogether alone, and never have medled with it at all; for who indeed can but ſo much as touch with <hi>O. S.</hi> in this his Pitch, but he or they will be ſure to be defiled therewith.</p>
            <p>And further, as to my Charge againſt him, as with reſpect to his ſo hanging down of his Head at the aforeſaid Meeting, held at <hi>W. L's</hi> the 2d. of the 10th. Month, 1694. It was true, and is really ſo; yea, and that too as one, or a man condemned in himſelf, and alſo as true and certain that he ſlunk, haſted, and ſhifted away as ſoon as ever had gained his Earthly and Coverous Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> gotten the Money he ſo unjuſtly, yet ſo eagerly preſt for, ſought and coveted after; though as in the <hi>Cry,</hi> but the effects of his Partner Excequitor induſtry, care, hazard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the which, as was then made moſt evidently appear; yea, and that to his Face, that he would not ſomuch as touch with him in it, or be in the leaſt concern'd, either to the proof of the Will, its improvement, or hazard in the putting forth Money; and if not ſo, and this not true, as have charged him, why did he not then procure a Certificate of thoſe he ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:172122:47"/>for his own Friends, ſeeing ſo acute and ſuch an Artiſt at it, as in the caſe forecited, in that of the <hi>Charlow</hi> one.</p>
            <p>And further, as to his jocular Flout about my keeping of my Shop ſometimes ſhut, and ſometimes open, on thoſe Days they call <hi>Faſt Days,</hi> I do not remember that I kept mine ſhut above once or twice at the moſt, and that too was upon the altering or change of the Government from a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> to a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> one; and I think as with reſpect to thoſe matters, that I have been as ſteady in it, and ſuffered more both by Impriſonment, daring Affronts, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Windows, than either <hi>O. S. W. L. J. B.</hi> or any of them all; though as before, that ſince the Change, I have not ſeen, or at leaſt in my thoughts altogether ſo much Reaſon for it, as in time of our Perſecution, when our Perſecutors by the ſame Law that they enjoyned us to keep them ſhut, did likewiſe require us to go to Church and to hear that they called <hi>Divine Service</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And again, after his frequent and uſual way of Scoffing and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thus proceeds: <hi>And after he</hi> (meaning of my ſelf) <hi>had brought his Book,</hi> ſaith he) <hi>to an end, and ſet to it the End, he addeth four pages more, ſhewing himſelf confuſed, and whimſical in the manner as well as the matter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Of which ſhall give the Reader an impartial and true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and to leave him to judge, I having as he ſaith, ended my Book, yea, and ſet to it the End alſo, it came into my Mind, and that for Peace and the Truth ſake, for to try them again, and yet further for to ſee that if by any way or means they might have been prevailed upon to have removed the Cauſe, and thereby ſtopped and prevented the going forth and publiſhing of the aforeſaid, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, I writ a Letter to <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> with intreaty for him to uſe his utmoſt Intereſt and Endeavours with them; in order thereunto obſerve, yea, and that as often hinted, when I had not only been at the loſs of time and pains to write it, but at the coſt and charge of the Printing of it: But when I ſaw that nothing was likely to be further done in it, I then added by way of Appendix unto the aforeſaid, the Copy of the ſaid Letter, with the annexing of ſome remarkable Obſervations upon the inconſiſtency, uncertainty, unſound and changeable temper of the ſaid <hi>O. S.</hi> and in particular in his ſo forwardly and largely propoſing for the referring of the ſaid Difference, to the hearing of the Antient Friends of <hi>London,</hi> as in pag. 13, 14, and 48. of the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. And yet for him to ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear againſt, oppoſe, withſtand, and at laſt too denyed it (a Man ſo ready and forward for to charge others with being ſo ſhattered, confuſed, whimſical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And a Word further ſtill
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:172122:47"/>remains with me concerning the aforeſaid Act and Action of his, give me leave therefore to thus expreſs it before I end and conclude with him, <hi>viz. Oh thou wicked one, and full of all Subtilty and Craft, thou haſt not lyed herein only unto men, but unto God, and unto him ſhall thou give an account for it, with the reſt of thy wicked and evil Deeds, a Man that art ſo hardy and ſo void of true Sence, as not to be afraid of ſome eminent and immediate ſtroak from his juſt and impartial Hand, as an Example of his diſpleaſure and wrath, upon thee for ſuch thy deceit and wickedneſs, which I even dread to think of, and am even as aſtoniſhed to conſider.</hi> And yet for all this, to thus and ſo talk and tell in the concluſion of his Book, as in pag. 46. of anothers appearing before the dreadful Tribunal and Judgment Seat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But again, as likewiſe deſiring that ſome Antient Friends would or might be ſo far concern'd (if but for the Truth's ſake) as to examine or know of <hi>O. S.</hi> what manner or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Puniſhment is to be, or muſt be, that my Body is to ſuffer or be puniſhed withal, ſeeing that he had uſed ſuch ſcaring Threats of Corporeal or Bodily Puniſhment. As alſo to, or concerning his ſo wickedly perverting and corrupting that Scripture, cited by him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. it being thus, <hi>viz. And ſo art Judged,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by the Apoſtle to be a Murderer.</hi> And from the aforeſaid occaſion, did likewiſe adviſe him in the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 8.22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy Wickedneſs, and pray to God, if perhaps the thoughts of thy Heart may be forgiven thee, for I perceive that thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And for this, and no other cauſe, that can think or know of, hath he ſo branded me as in pag. 44. with <hi>Billingsgate-Rhetorick,</hi> and which happily he may think to be both Argument and Anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to all thoſe Charges contained in the aforeſaid four Pages, he mentions in pag. 45. of his, the which nevertheleſs with the reſt of them doth ſtand, will it ſtand and remain, as both Charges and matter of Fact, and that as found prov'd and fix'd upon him, unleſs he anſwers them by deep and unfeigned Repentance, for all the Clutter and Buſſel that he makes at the end or concluſion of this his ſaid Evil and Envious Work, <hi>viz.</hi> as if he could look God, Heaven, Eternity, Men and Angels in the Face.</p>
            <p>And then again in the ſame page in that ſaith he, which he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſhort addition, he ſays thus, <hi>viz. Neither this nor any other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of any nature or kind whatever, is or can in truth be ſaid to be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the Reconcilation be wrought, and Peace be made between the party differing, and this,</hi> (ſaith he, meaning of me) <hi>one would think is ſo plain and clear, that no capacity, though never ſo weak or ſmall, but muſt needs diſcern, believe and ſee it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And is it not as I have ſaid, and Truth what I have ſaid, for how can it in Truth, or at all be ſaid that a Difference is ended,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:172122:48"/>before it is ended, or when it is not ended, neither Peace nor the Reconciliation made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what kind of Rhetorick <hi>O. S.</hi> count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as authentick or profound, if this be falſe and profane; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I know not.</p>
            <p>And then proceeds in a ſcoffing way, and further ſaith, <hi>If his capacity had not been of the ſmalleſt ſize, be might have diſcerned what a Foundation he has laid, ſhould it be allow'd to perpetuate Differences, and render them impoſſible ever to be ended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer; Should it be allow'd, what allow'd <hi>O. S.</hi> that a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this or any other kind, is not nor cannot in truth be ſaid to be ended, when in truth it is not ended. Shall therefore leave the Reader to make his own Obſervation upon it, and alſo whether this be like the Language of <hi>Sion</hi> he mentions in pag. 2. of his, or the confuſion that's found in <hi>Babylon?</hi> as alſo, whether it doth at all or in the leaſt render any difference impoſſible, as before, ever to be ended, becauſe that I ſaid that it cannot in truth be ſaid to be ended, when in truth it is not. And then again ſaith he, <hi>It's too frequently ſeen in ſuch caſes, that one or both of the differing parties do obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be reconciled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer; And what and if it be ſo, doth and muſt their ſaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinancy ſo change the caſe, and alter the State and Condition of things, as to thus impower you or thoſe which were but Arbitarors or Referies before, and that in order to Peace, Reconciliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That thereby or for that cauſe of either the one or both's obſtinancy, to make you or any elſe become their Judges and Sentencers; and what a Foundation of intollerable Thraldom, Vaſſalidge, Slavery, Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, if ſhould be granted, hath he thereby laid, and that this and ſuch is both the Foundation and Structure that <hi>O. S.</hi> and theſe Men are for laying and building his and there Houſe upon, both their Language and Speech bewrays them, and their Words and Works do too evidently manifeſt and make appear. But if any one ſhould ask and ſay, Why what then is to be done in the caſe, when either one or both of the parties differing, be obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be reconciled? Anſwer (though have ſpoken to it before) all that the Referies have to do, or can do further in it, is only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and perſwade them to Condeſcention and Compliance; and if they cannot, or that will not prevail, they ſhould, ought and muſt ſtill patiently wait till either they, or one of them, be of a better mind, and as often ſeen that although not preſently done or at firſt, yet not ſo wholly ineffectual, ſo the aforeſaid do their parts, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and accompliſht at laſt. But thee, even thee <hi>O. S.</hi> and the reſt of the Seven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not truely ſo exerciſed as they ought, and the ſtate of the caſe required, whatever have ſaid or pretended,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:172122:48"/>or at all as men truely uſing the right way and means in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as more at large, and in particular in pag. 27. of my ſaid Book, the <hi>Cry,</hi> &amp;c. And then further, at the lower end of the ſaid page, ſaith he, (ſpeaking of me) <hi>He grants at length thus,</hi> viz. <hi>That if the Parties or Referies to whom the matter in difference is refer'd, be in good earneſt and do uſe their utmoſt indeavour for Peace and Reconciliation, yet if any one of the Perſons or Parties concern'd, do ſtand out and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all the reſt are clear and to be excuſed, and the blame wholly and alone to be placed upon the obſtinate or refuſing Perſon or Party, in caſe that partiality and injuſtice be not the cauſe of his averneſs.</hi> Anſwer; To which do again return, and ſay, as before, <hi>viz.</hi> that in Juſtice and Partiality, and that yet, and it only and alone was the cauſe and occaſion of my non-compliance, and beſides, I was the Plantiff or Accuſer, although to be obſerved and noted as often and frequently hinted, that thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſaid ſeven were not choſen or intended for either Judges or Judgment, but Reconcilers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and beſides there's a great deal of difference too between a Perſon being blamed, and the paſſing and giving of Judgment and Sentence againſt him; and then proceeds on and ſaith <hi>O. S. This I like well, and am ſo fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we whom he unjuſtly calls the ſeven unjuſt Judges, to whom the matter in defference betwixt</hi> W. L. J. B. <hi>and himſelf were refer'd, were in very good earneſt, and did uſe our utmoſt indeavour for Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi> Anſwer; A meer Conceit and vain Oſtentation, for if were ſo choſen, why did you not do it, and anſwer the end of your choice? what hinder'd, except partiality, partiſhip and intereſt? nor his fully aſſurance worthy the taking any notice of, or ſerveth more or otherways than only for himſelf; and in their and his own caſe, elſe the contrary both plain and apparent to all that have Eyes of their own, and will not be bound to make uſe of or ſee by his or theirs, as appears, and that from firſt to laſt by both Words and Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then again proceeds, faining and inſinuating to his Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> with what a great Satisfaction and Peace of mind he can and do, leave and ſubmit it to the Judgment of God's holy Witneſs in the Hearts of his People here, and to the Judgment Seat of Chriſt hereafter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſwer: And therefore let me ſay, oh how can this confident and hardy Man thus dally, dare, and jeſt with God, his holy Spirit and Eternity, as thinking or believing him and them to be ſuch another, or others as himſelf; but let me return back upon him the concluſive Words of his own Book in pag. 46. <hi>viz.</hi> that he muſt certainly for all this be rewarded according to his doings, for fair Words and Sayings will not then and at that day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, nor ſtand him in any ſtead, nor yet wipe of the guilt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his or any ſuch evil corrupt and defiled Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:172122:49"/>And then proceeds, <hi>But ſeeing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is ſo plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by poſitive Evidence and moſt clear demonſtration which cannot be deny'd,</hi> (but pray obſerve whether and how far this man leaves it, and with what limitation and injunction) viz. <hi>that</hi> A. B. <hi>is deeply guilty of doing him great Wrong.</hi> Anſw: But if ſo, I pray wherein and by what? for I know not, neither is it apparent or proved, except by thus diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laying open his Craft, Falſe-heartedneſs and Deceit, as thus acted under the guiſe and notion of Truth, Sanactity, Divine Sence and Religion. And this farther,</p>
            <p>That as in my ſaid Book and Books, it's truly &amp; alone on my part, in holy Zeal for the truth of God, and the Anſwering of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in his ſight, and not for Name, Praiſe, Intereſt or Profit; (though do much queſtion, as have cauſe ſo to do, whether <hi>O. S.</hi> be not guilty of them all,) has been, was, and is the Principal cauſe, that have thus concern'd and ingag'd me with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then proceeds, <hi>And therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God's holy witneſs in the Hearts of his People, which is juſt and true, muſt needs Judge and Condemn him.</hi> Anſwer: I ſay again as I did before, pray ſee and obſerve how this man leaves it to the witneſs of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how he alſo mocks, and as we uſe to ſay, makes a meer Noſe of Wax of the Holy Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to be thus bowed both any and every way to ſerve his Ends and Intereſt; for though he pretends to ſo leave and commit it, <hi>viz.</hi> to God's Holy Witneſs, as twice or thrice over and over again in the aforeſaid page, and yet at laſt ſee how he preſcribes, directs, and dictates unto it, and tells what it ought and muſt needs do, and be done, and that is for to both Judge and Condemn <hi>A. B.</hi> ſo it may be ſtill, and it further obſerv'd, that though he ſo mockingly and in ſuch deceit commiteth it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that yet notwithſtanding doth at laſt deprive and exclude them both in it, <hi>viz.</hi> both the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, and Witneſs of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and entereth upon the Judgment and Determination of the matter himſelf, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to let them both-know like a Judge on the Bench (eſpecially when pretend, like himſelf to ſuch a prerogative) to the Jury in what they are and ought to do, and which is, <hi>viz.</hi> that they cannot avoid, but muſt, needs and ought to both Judge, give Sentence againſt, and Condemn <hi>A. B.</hi> And as to the reſt of his Fallacies and Hypocritical and feigned Inſinuations, as if all this and ſuch his evil Works, Treachery and evil Treatment towards me, were in love, and for the good of my Soul. To which I ſhall ſay little more at preſent, rather leaving and commending the impartial Reader for his better Satisfaction to the Reading of my former Books, ſo often and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cited, and then for to make his own Obſervation upon the aforeſaid Actions; for his Words prove little, and his Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:172122:49"/>leſs, and withal in his comparing to joyn and annex unto it the many ſhameful Flouts, Jeers, Scoffs, Scorns and Deriding Words and expreſſions he has given forth and made by way of a Game or Sport upon me, in order to reproach and vilifie me; I ſay as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this Book of his he hath Titled, <hi>A Reviler Rebuked,</hi> &amp;c. And the which he intends for an Anſwer unto mine, of <hi>The Cry of the oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. and which the Reader by comparing together, may ſoon find out, and ſee how far this Man's Heart and Tongue doth agree and hold together, as likewiſe whether the love and good he is for or pretends by Word, be at all or in the leaſt any other then the tender Mercies of the Wicked, which is Cruelty.</p>
            <p>And now to draw towards a Concluſion, having, as I conceive, gone through, and either Anſwered or ſhown the Impertinency and Inconſiſtency of all, or at leaſt of every material branch or part of this his Evil and Envious Work, I do in the next place think fit to give my Reader this following and further Account of the ſaid <hi>O. S.</hi> which I doubt not but may prove to the further confuſing and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal marring both of all the whole, yea, and every part of this his confuſed and envious Work, which take as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> After yet, I had Printed and Publiſh'd a great or the greateſt part of my Books, Titled <hi>The Cry of the oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O. S.</hi> ſent me a Letter dated from <hi>Abingdon</hi> the 6 of the 12th Month, 1695. And unto which I return'd him a plain and judicious Anſwer, and with equal Terms and Conditions according to the Contents thereof.</p>
            <p>The Tenor or Principal Contents of the aforeſaid Letter of his to me being thus, or to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> To both earneſtly deſire, requeſt, and intreat me for to call in my ſaid Book or Books again, and aſſuring that by ſuch my Compliance, and ſo doing, it ſhould be accepted, be Satisfaction, and ſo the Controverſie to be ended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The which I do deſire and earneſtly intreat of the Reader to obſerve and to take good notice of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that after the aforeſaid <hi>O. S. W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> &amp;c. had ſo violently and outragiouſly clamour'd, highly charged, thus notoriouſly branded and abuſed me, together with the reſt of the Seven (his Companions) in the ſecond to thus and ſo arraign, paſs Judgment, give Sentence, and Condemn me, and that for ſuch a Criminal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and farther in ſo accounting of me and others, as hinted, but for or no other than as <hi>Trees that cumbered the Ground, and good for nothing but to be pluckt up, and to be caſt into the Fire; Thrives that entered not in by the Door,</hi> but ſuch as only came for to <hi>Kill</hi> and to <hi>Steal, Wells without Water and Clouds without Rain,</hi> for whom is reſerved the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs forever, <hi>betraying Judas</hi>'s, Brother to <hi>Bugg,</hi> and like to <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Story; Doggs, Wolves, Swine, Lyons, Bares,</hi> &amp;c. baſe Abortive Illigetimate <hi>Brait,

L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> as in pag. 20 of the <hi>Cry.</hi> And then again, as with reſpect alſo to the aforeſaid Seven (as in their ſaid Paper of Judgment, O. S. in pag. 10. to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That after their waitings (ſay they) in the light of Chriſt our Lord, the Sence and Judgment that we have receiv'd is on this wiſe, viz. <hi>That</hi> A. B <hi>hath not been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the pure peaceable Wiſdom that is from above, but in the Earthly and ſenſual Wiſdom hath been watching over his Brethren with an evil Eye, and ſeeking occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and thereby hath much hurt and darkned himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve, implying as if that thoſe Articles I had drawn up and given in, in charge againſt the aforeſaid, <hi>viz. W. L.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> &amp;c. had been gathered up together and treaſured up not by that Spirit, wherein the fellowſhip of the Goſpel ſtandeth, and Bond of Peace is kept, but in a wrong Spirit, out of the Counſel of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more over and beſides <hi>O.S</hi>'s. thus and ſo thundering forth like ſo many Curſes, the Wrath and Vengeance of God againſt me, as in pag. 36. of the <hi>Cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore deſire and intreat it again, the Reader to obſerve and conſider how that though as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, as before hinted in this Treatiſe, that the wiſe Woman builded up her Houſe, yet how like the Fooliſh one this Man <hi>O. S.</hi> hath thus pulled down his and theirs, and that with his own Hands, and to prove it ſo and the matter true, as charged, pray give me leave to a little further Reaſon and Expoſtulate the matter more cloſely and plainly with him, and therefore ſhall add to it, and ſay what <hi>O. S.</hi> Is a <hi>A. B.</hi> indeed and in reality guilty of thoſe ſo many, ſo high, ſo groſs, ſo great and notorious Crimes and Wickedneſs; yea, and that both againſt God, and his Brethren, as to be ſo and thus judged and accounted as deſerving of all thoſe moſt horrid and unparelell Cruel and Severe Reviling, Vilifying, Branding, Stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing and Reproaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo of ſuch hard and ſevere Threats, Sentences and Amerſments by <hi>O. S. W. L. J. B.</hi> &amp;c. and the reſt of the ſaid Seven, and that too as if but what they had receiv'd the ſence of, as in the power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with or in Commiſſion from the Lord himſelf, in their waitings upon him, as in pag. 10. of the <hi>Cry;</hi> and pag. 15. of his <hi>A Reviler,</hi> &amp;c. to ſo pronounce and give forth their ſaid Judgment and Sentence againſt me, and yet for all this my Crime and Crimes to be found at laſt, when he and they are brought to a Pinch to be it, no greater nor no more in it, and the buſineſs ſo ſlender and ſlight, as that barely upon the condition only of my calling in of my Books, that came ſo cloſe and hard upon them all ſhould be at the end, all to be huſhed up, quiet, ſtill, and the matter ſolved up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in plain, my ſelf abſolved without any Father-Confeſſion. Friends bare with me, for my Soul and Life deteſts, abhors, defys and ſurgeth againſt all ſuch Groſs, Subtil and Perfidious wicked Hypocriſie, great and deep deceit, a peice I think as great and notorious (the Circumſtances conſidered) as ever was done or acted by any Man or Men before, as likewiſe to the ſame import, in pag. 26. of the <hi>Cry.</hi> And further obſerve Reader, that although this man <hi>O. S.</hi> were ſo hardy and confident, in the Hearts of his People here, and to the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt too hereafter, as if ſo innocent, that he could look both God, Eternity Men and Angels in the Face; yet after all, notwithſtanding to be thus appeal'd and ſo ſtruck into and under ſuch a Dreadful fear and manifeſt Conſternation, at the very appearance and coming forth of my ſaid Book into Print, a peice that ſo openly diſcovereth and maketh manifeſt his own and the reſt of his Faction and Aſſociates Treachery, Oppreſſion, Unjuſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that rather then he will ſtand the Judgment ſo much as of a Man, Men, or the appearance of the Day, he as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:172122:50"/>thinks it now more ſafe and far better for him to lay by ſuch his ſcaring Threats of the puniſhing of Body and Ireful Judgments, both on the right Hand and on the left, poured forth and pronounced againſt me, as contain'd in a Letter which he ſent me but a little before, and to Anvil out another way, and to his Craft again, if he can but, as no doubt he will out-face Shame, and what elſe relates to either Men or Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having reflected ſo much on <hi>A. B.</hi> though Innocent as by his own Inconſiſtency; for how can <hi>A. B.</hi> or any other, though their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore Friendly and Chriſtian <hi>Reader,</hi> upon the whole matter and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, may I not break out in this aſtoniſhment, open my Mouth, and ſay, O bluſh, oh Heavens! and be aſtoniſh'd oh Earth, at theſe things! And this further, ſo that by all what hath been ſaid, written, and apparently and plainly proved upon them, <hi>viz. O. S.</hi> and the reſt, the true and conſcious Reader may plainly ſee and diſcern as before, how contrary both to themſelves as well as unto the Truth, I mean the real Truth of God, theſe Men have acted in the premiſed, by being thus falſe to God, falſe to Men, falſe to their own Conſciences, and falſe to what they have Signed and given under their own Hands, and which ſtands, will remain, and will be in Witneſs againſt them until they acknowledge by Repentance; for indeed how can that be according to God, or conſiſtent with his Will, that is ſo vaſtly wide and altogether inconſiſtent with its ſelf, as in p. 14. and <hi>laſt Query</hi> of my Book of <hi>Queries.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith my Soul, Oh that the Lord for his Name, for his Truth, and for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake, would be pleaſed to both root out, and to drive and chaſt away out of his Church and Camp all ſuch evil and deceitful Work and Works, and all ſuch double-tongu'd and falſe-hearted ones, and to cauſe it to exterminate, and its Remembrance to End and ceaſe amongſt Men, and eſpecially all the Profeſſors of his Holy Name and Truth. And therefore his, <hi>viz.</hi> this <hi>O. S</hi>'s bad, treacherous, evil and deceitful Ways and Circumſtances conſidered, may I not further add and thus infer concerning him.</p>

            <p>And now a few Lines more in Anſwer to his needleſs and unprofitable <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> which chiefly relates to my placing, as he ſaith, ſome unneceſſary or impertinent <hi>et ſetera's,</hi> or more than happily convenient or proper, the which I ſhall not ſo much diſpute or ſtand the Teſt of the Controverſie with him, the whole aim, end and bent of my Spirit being more for and with reſpect to Truth, Juſtice, Subſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then to either Puctilio's, or the Rules or Uſe of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172122:51"/>Grammatical Methods, having neither pretended to either Skill or Scholarſhip in thoſe and ſuch things, and wherein I have miſſed or been ſhort in them, or any I think that he ſilly and a witleſs'd me enough about them. But in this I have rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and have cauſe ſtill to rejoyce, and to both bleſs, to magnifie and praiſe the Name of the Lord my God, my Rock and my Stay, in that he hath ſo far taught and learned me in the School of Chriſt, his dear Son, Truth, Righteouſneſs, and in the Book of an innocent and a good Conſcience, ſo as that I could not, nor cannot in the leaſt abet, cloſe with, cover or connive at any ſuch wicked, falſe, deceitful and evil doings, that is ſo too frequently and often found both in him and them he perſonates and undertakes for; but as to the caſe of the Widow <hi>Bunce</hi> and her Son, which he ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s as his firſt Example, I think neceſſary to annex theſe two or three Lines further. And firſt, as with reſpect to the Offence that the ſaid <hi>John Bunce</hi> had taken, it is to be noted that it was taken upon, or through the occaſion of <hi>O. S.</hi> and the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing or denying his Mother a juſt and fair Hearing by her Neighbours that beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Nature and Circumſtances of the caſe, and which only related unto outward Concerns, wherein ſhe apprended as in the aforeſaid, That ſhe had the due right of Claim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not that they had any thing otherways or further againſt him; and therefore the caſe, with the Circumſtances depending, rightly and duly conſidered, whether it may not give both cauſe and room to conclude, or at leaſt to think that he went to the aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prieſt for ſomething elſe, than only for a Wife; for that it appears not at all unreaſonable, but to both ſuppoſe and think that he might go to him for to learn Religion alſo, yea, and ſomething elſe beſides that too, he ſeeing and finding ſuch unfair and unjuſt dealings in the aforeſaid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Mother, that pretended to that degree of Senſe, Light, and Spiritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning above and beyond all others; ſo that if no more impertinency in my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plentious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then appears in this he places, as the firſt of his Examples, he might have ſtaid out his time in the Country where he was, if a doing of any good there, then to a ſo haſted, to a thus only ſhowed his own Skill and Scholarſhip; and if ſuch a Fault in <hi>A.

S.</hi> for to ſend unto me ſuch a Book, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>A Reviler, &amp;c.</hi> to one I ſay that he looked upon, and accounted as his Enemy, that had ſo many both falſe and confuſed Miſplacings, both troubleſome to read, and much more to Anſwer, they being as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> after <hi>pag.</hi> 30. followeth <hi>p.</hi> 33. after <hi>p.</hi> 34. followeth 31. after <hi>p.</hi> 32. followeth <hi>p.</hi> 37. after <hi>p.</hi> 38. followeth <hi>p.</hi> 35. after <hi>p.</hi> 36. followeth <hi>p.</hi> 39. But theſe not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo material neither, either on the one hand, or on the other, as his ſo hipping and skipping, as I may ſay, over Mountains and Hills, and thus ſtumbling, or rather quarrelling at meer Turfs or Mould-Hills, my meaning being by his ſo skipping, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and giving the Go by to thoſe more material and ſubſtantial parts of my afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, without either Notice taken, or any anſwer or return at all, as at large have mention'd and hinted in the foregoing.

And thus having ſomewhat eaſed my grieved Heart and wounded Spirit, becauſe of theſe things, and enlarg'd therein beyond Intentions, I do leave and commend them to the righteous Judge and true witneſs of God in every Conſcience, and remain a true Lover of all the honeſt and ſincere in Heart,</p>
